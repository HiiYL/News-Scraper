It’s difficult to justify purchasing this smartphone over any of the other 2016 flagships that have and are soon to be arriving on our shores. But, here’s the thing, you don’t have to do that because the Huawei Mate 8 has one big advantage over the competition. Don’t get me wrong, the Mate 8 will run pretty much as smoothly as any of the other flagships in the market right now. With the help of Huawei’s new silicone and Android 6.0 Marshmallow, you probably won’t even notice any of the minor stutters I did unless you’re coming from a   device. It’s even pretty good in the camera department. Nothing to shout about, but it is certainly capable of taking some great shots. It’s also got a massive battery that should easily last the average user an average day. But, if I had to pick one standout feature, it would be the device’s big screen.

Initially   for Android users via Open Whisper Systems, the new encryption now covers all forms of communications including WhatsApp calls, photos, videos and file transfers on both Android and iOS platforms.  If you’re running on the latest version of WhatsApp, encryption will be enabled automatically by default. Whether you’re chatting to an individual or in a group, you can be rest assured that no third party will be able to tap into your conversations. You should notice a subtle message indicating that your chat and voice calls are encrypted end to end.  This will only work if all parties have encryption enabled and you can check if your contact or group is secured by going into Group Info > Encryption. If a member doesn’t have encryption enabled, an open lock icon will appear and they would need to update WhatsApp to close the loop.  To verify if the encryption is valid with a specific individual, you can check the Security code by comparing the 60 digit code or by scanning the QR code. For group chats, you’ll get a lock icon if all members are compliant.  The folks at WhatsApp have a strong desire to protect personal privacy and they believe encryption is ultimately the key for the future of personal communication. Co-Founder Jan Koum also shared about life in the former USSR where people couldn’t speak freely under communist rule. Today WhatsApp assures that more than a billion of its users can talk freely and securely."

For photos, the device gets a 13-megapixel primary camera with PDAF and a front-facing 8-megapixel selfie shooter. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000 mAh battery. While the internals are impressive, we’re a little on the fence about the looks of the smartphone. Sure, it’s got a nice full-metal unibody with rounded edges for better feel-in-hand. But, it just looks so much like an OPPO R series smartphone and I think we have more than enough of that design. That said, the V3Max also packs a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, dual-SIM support, LTE connectivity, Quick Charge and will come running Android Lollipop out of the box. You can’t exactly buy the smartphone right now, but you can pre-order the device from authorised Vivo retailers in Malaysia, or   for RM1,399.

Well,  we’re going to find out soon enough as   and   exchange blows on social media in their latest attempt to serve each other with the most generous helping of sick burns.

Rory Lee,The iPhone SE has the same display as the 5s according to iFixit’s teardown,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/04/01/the-iphone-se-has-the-same-display-as-the-5s-according-to-ifixits-teardown/,"apple,Apple iPhone,Apple iPhone SE,ifixit,iPhone,iPhone SE,iPhone SE teardown,iPhone SE teardown iFixit,smartphone teardown","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-04-01,"When a new phone comes out, the popular thing to do these days is to tear it down to find out exactly what’s inside these devices because clearly people want to know what they’ve spent their hard-earned money on. While Chipworks had their go at prying open the  , now it’s iFixit’s turn to have their way with  ‘s latest and what they reveal is actually rather interesting. It doesn’t take a genius to guess what smartphone the iPhone SE was based on, one look will tell you that it’s the spitting image of Apple’s older iPhone 5s. The question is, what’s new? Well, not the display apparently. In iFixit’s comprehensive teardown, one of the first things they noticed was that the iPhone SE had the exact same display as the older iPhone 5s. So similar, in fact, that they’re practically interchangeable. Yup, that means not only are the guides already available for those who want to DIY swap their broken iPhone SE displays for a new one, but you could theoretically use an old iPhone 5s’s panel too. The best part is that the display is plug and play between the two devices, so once you hook up the necessary connectors, the panel fires right up. Many have labeled the iPhone SE as an iPhone 5s stuffed full of iPhone 6s parts but that may not actually be entirely accurate. The 12-megapixel iSight camera, for example, may theoretically be the same as the one on the iPhone 6s, they’re not interchangeable. It is, however, quite different from the old iPhone 5s’s snapper (note the number of connectors) on the left, which is to be expected. You’d be happy to know that the iPhone SE also comes with a bigger 1,624 mAh battery, up from the iPhone 5s’s 1,560 mAh. Not a major upgrade, but coupled with improved battery optimisations, users should see an improvement in battery life over the iPhone 5s. Unfortunately, unlike the apparently interchangeable displays, the battery connectors on the iPhone SE differs from the 5s’s so no supercharging your old 5s. Another interesting thing that iFixit discovered was the waterproofing seals. Apple placed foamy silicone seals surrounding some but not all of the logic board connections. Curious. Wouldn’t Apple have wanted to maximise water protection throughout their device? I guess some corners had to be cut after all, but then again you shouldn’t be too disappointed as Apple   the iPhone SE as a waterproof device anyway. Be sure to check out iFixit’s   of the device if you want to learn more. What do you guys think of the iPhone SE’s internals? Is it worth the money?"

In new pictures and renders by both   and  , the Huawei P9 is now proudly displaying it’s Leica branding. What’s a little disappointing to me though is that Leica didn’t go for the “red dot” branding, instead opting to just print their name on the back of the familiar P9. That said, the typeface used for the branding is consistent with those found on Leica’s own camera lenses so this lends some credibility to the images. From the pictures, the camera is bearing Leica’s Summarit badge with what looks like an aperture of f/2.2 and an equivalent focal length of 27mm. The lens array could also feature an aspherical element as denoted by the “ASPH” markings (though do correct me if I’m wrong). Besides the Leica glass, the Huawei P9 is rumoured to feature a dual camera setup on the back with each sensor featuring 12-megapixels. Said to be an evolution of the one on the  , the P9’s dual snappers should sport much of the features found on the 6 Plus including post-capture refocus and simulated aperture adjustments. This is exciting stuff. If I’m being honest, one of my biggest qualms with any of the Huawei devices I’ve used was the rather lackluster camera performance. Now with the German camera maker’s help, Huawei could very well have shored up one of their big weaknesses. Huawei’s P9 is set to be   on the 6th of April — and rumoured to come in   — so we’ll get confirmation of this and everything else then. For now, these are still just rumours so do take it with a grain of salt. What do you guys think of the P9? Would Leica glass be good enough to tempt you into picking one up?"

Available for FIRST Gold customers in the Klang Valley only. The fixed fibre broadband scene is heating up as   joins the race with their Home Broadband service offering speeds of up to 10Mbps. According to Lowyat.net, the telco’s new plan would be called the Celcom Home Broadband and will offer speeds of 10Mbps for RM145/month (excl GST). If you’re a   subscriber, you will receive a 50% discount for the first six months of your Home Broadband subscription. That means you pay RM72.50/month (excl GST) for the first six months. Lowyat.net also claims that this plan is targetted towards Celcom subscribers, but made no mention on whether non-Celcom subscribers are eligible. For calls, the Celcom Home Broadband will charge users 8sen/min to all networks, while IDD calls will follow Celcom Postpaid’s IDD rates and will be charged in 30-second blocks. The following table provides a detailed breakdown of the plan: Lowyat.net’s information came from an anonymous source, so we thought we’d call Celcom up and see if we could verify it. According to the Celcom customer service representative, the telco did indeed “launch” their plan today which lends credence to Lowyat.net’s source. The customer service rep confirms all the plan details in the table above and that it is indeed available from today onwards, however, he did not have any information regarding the coverage area. That said, he did inform us that users who wished to sign up or find out if their area was covered could simply visit a Celcom Blue Cube for more information. We have a hunch that Celcom’s fibre service will be using  ‘s High-Speed Broadband infrastructure (like Maxis Fibre) due to an   between the parties. This means if your area is covered by UniFi, you will likely be able to get Celcom Home Broadband too. Although today was supposed to be the launch, there is still no information about this plan on the Celcom website. The Celcom customer service rep ensures that you will be able to get more information on their website soon. It is worth noting that this isn’t Celcom’s first stab at a fibre broadband as they did have a   back in 2012. Looking at the plan, we’re not terribly impressed by it. It’s fine if you’re a light user that only wants to spend the bare minimum on fibre Internet connectivity, but if you’re a moderate or heavy user, you’re better off topping up a little extra for about two or three times faster speeds on   or  . You could also add RM4 more and get  ‘s 100Mbps plan — if you can find yourself within their coverage area, but that’s only slightly less difficult than finding a unicorn. The way we see it, the most attractive thing about this plan is the fact that you can get 50% off for the first six months if you’re a Celcom FIRST Gold plan subscriber. Besides that, you’re probably better off with one of the new plans from the other fibre providers. Want more information on the new fibre plans from TIME, TM and Maxis? Check out our  . Want a laugh?

But that’s not all, they’ve also released a budget device that is now the cheapest device in Malaysia with a fingerprint scanner. The highlight of DOOGEE’s launch has to be their Android flagship smartphone, the F7 Pro. On the front of the smartphone, you’ll find a 5.7-inch full-HD IGZO display that has slim bezels and is tucked under 2.5D glass for a more rounded finish. Encased in its metal is the world’s first deca-core processor — the MediaTek Helio X20 — mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. For photos, the F7 Pro gets a 21-megapixel Sony IMX230 sensor on the back with Phase Detection AF. Selfies are taken care of by a 13-megapixel front-facing snapper. Keeping the lights on is a generous 4,000 mAh battery that can be charged up via a USB Type-C port and the smartphone will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow. While this is DOOGEE’s flagship device, there was no mention of a price, but the company did say that the smartphone will go on sale sometime in Q2 of 2016. Having a phone with a big battery is like having big hands –some people like to tell everyone about it. If you’re this kind of person, then the DOOGEE T6 is the Android smartphone for you as it packs a massive 6,250 mAh battery. Everything else is a little underwhelming, however. On the front, it gets a 5.5-inch HD 720p display with a MediaTek MT6735 quad-core processor mated to 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. For photos, it gets an 8-megapixel/2-megapixel camera combo. The smartphone will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop. The DOOGEE T6 is priced at RM599 and will come in Marble White and Titanium Grey. It will go on sale exclusively at   from today (31st March) onwards. Rounding up the smartphone launches is another budget friendly device — the Y200 — one of the cheapest smartphones with a fingerprint sensor in Malaysia. Coming in at RM699 it is a touch cheaper than the   and its fingerprint sensor is mounted on the front of the device, not the rear like both the Redmi Note 3 and the DOOGEE F7 Pro. In terms of specs, the Y200 gets a 5.5-inch HD 720p display and pretty much the same internals as the T6 above, except it has a 32GB of internal storage. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000 mAh battery while photos are taken care of by an 8MP/5MP camera combo. It will also come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Alongside its three smartphone reveals, DOOGEE also launched a pico projector called the Smart Cube P1 and a 3G smartwatch called the S1. The Smart Cube P1 is a funky little device that is a projector and a speaker unit rolled into a cube that can fit in the palm of your hand. The projector beam can shoot up to 3.3m to a width of 90 inches. As it has a built-in speaker, you can use it as a nifty portable media consumption device on-the-go. You won’t be getting super high-resolution projects, though, as it only projects at a resolution of 854×480 (WVGA). The Smart Cube P1 supports multiple devices with Air Play, DLNA, Miracast, Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity. The P1 offers a Texas Instrument DLP with 70 lumen/3W brightness, OSRAM LED and 30,000 hours of LED lifetime. Keeping everything running is a 4,800 mAh battery which can double as a powerbank with a 5V2A output. Priced at RM999, it isn’t a cheap device, but you do get a decent amount of features for it. The Smart Cube P1 will go on sale in Q3 of 2016. DOOGEE claims that their S1 smartwatch is a full-featured wearable and to a certain extent, it is. It’s compatible with Android and you can insert a 3G SIM card into the watch. Since it has a microphone and speaker, you can make and receive calls with the device. It’s also got a heart-rate monitor, a 5MP camera, a 1.54-inch IPS (240×240 pixel) screen and is IP67 water resistant."

Maxis followed soon after. Now, it’s TM’s turn to round up the trifecta of new plans with their new UniFi Pro plan that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. As an early bird promo, TM is offering RM30/month off and you can start enjoying 100Mbps from as low as RM299/month with voice calls and IPTV bundled in. On the surface, it seems like a negligible difference compared to Maxis’ 100Mbps Home Fibre (RM330/month for MaxisONE postpaid customers) but if you take all the extras that come with your UniFi Pro plan into consideration, it offers much better value for your money. The base UniFi Pro plan is supposed to offer Internet speeds of up to 100Mbps plus a base HyppTV package (Aneka, Varnam or Ruby) for RM299/month (Normal: RM329). If you want the HyppTV Jumbo pack, you will have to top up an additional RM30, bringing the total to RM329 per month (Normal: RM359).  Besides that, the UniFi Pro plan looks to offer a free Voice Pack (worth RM20) which gives you 600 minutes of calls nationwide per month. If you exceed 600 minutes, you will be charged 10sen/min for calls to other fixed lines and mobile numbers but calls to TM fixed lines remain free. What’s more, you will also be able to stream HyppTV Everywhere on 2 devices, plus receive 500MB/day for TM WiFi. In addition to that, you will also have access to other UniFi perks like a free 12-month iflix subscription (worth RM96) and 3 months of Viu access. For Business users, the 100Mbps plan is offered at RM379/month (Normal: RM399) and it also comes with voice calls worth RM70. Any excess usage for fixed line numbers are still free but calls to mobile numbers are charged at 8 sen/minute.  To be fair, this UniFi Pro plan and Maxis’ MaxisONE Home 100Mbps plan, once again, doesn’t really compete with each other. The MaxisONE Home 100Mbps plan is only available in Maxis’ own areas of coverage (that is about 75,000 ports). These ports don’t overlap with UniFi’s own 1.89 million ports so the end result for the consumer is whether you have one or the other. Another difference is speed where TM offers 100Mbps for download and 50Mbps for upload. As usual, all subscription are tied with a 24-month contract.  If we were to take those factors out of the equation, the UniFi Pro plan is far better in terms of value-for-money as you’re getting high-speed Internet connectivity as well as a bunch of other goodies like IPTV and free streaming subscriptions. Another point against Maxis’ favour is that you have to be a MaxisONE Plan 158 and above subscriber to be eligible for the 100Mbps MaxisONE Home fibre Internet plan. If you were to factor that in with your monthly RM330, you’re paying RM488/month excluding GST."

These plans are designed to give customers high-speed Internet connectivity anywhere within Digi’s LTE-A coverage areas via the company’s new LTE-A capable MobiFi device. The Broadband 145 plan offers 50GB of Internet quota for RM145/month while the Broadband 185 will offer 100GB of Internet quota for RM185/month. Both plans will be available to customers starting 1st April 2016. If you’re a Digi Postpaid plan subscriber, you can get RM25 off the monthly bill which brings the total down to RM120 and RM160 for each plan respectively. Additionally, Digi Postpaid plan subscribers can also pick up the MobiFi mobile wireless router (which is a  ) for RM203 instead of the retail price of RM754. Digi also lets you pick up the MobiFi portable wireless router on contract. If you’re going with the Broadband 145 plan, you will have to pay a total of RM300 (RM145 for plan + RM155 for device upfront payment) while Broadband 185 subscribers only need to pay RM280 upfront (RM185 for plan + RM95 for device upfront payment). In addition to the upfront payments, you will also have to pay RM9 for the first 12 months. That means, if you get the Broadband 145 with a MobiFi device, you will be paying a total of RM263 (RM155 upfront + RM108 device) for the MobiFi while the Broadband 185’s MobiFi device will set you back a total of RM203 (RM95 upfront + RM108 device) This means, if you’re a Digi Postpaid customer going for the Broadband 145 plan, it’s actually cheaper to buy the MobiFi device outright because you will only need to pay RM203 for it. Of course, the Broadband 145 and 185 plans will work with pretty much any mobile wireless device that is LTE-A capable, so you don’t have to splurge on Digi’s MobiFi if you already have one lying around, or can pick one up for cheaper. Digi’s Mobifi does boast Cat 6 LTE speeds with support for 802.11ac WiFi, though. Keep in mind that the 50GB and 100GB of Internet quota are split between anytime quota and off-peak quota. For the Broadband 145 plan, 20GB will be allocated as anytime quota while 30GB is filed under off-peak quota (2am-8am). Meanwhile, the Broadband 185 sees an Internet quota split of 30GB of anytime quota and 70GB of off-peak quota. Once the quota is depleted, Broadband 185 users will have their speeds throttled to 512kbps but can still continue using the plan, unlike the Broadband 145 plan that simply cuts off once your quota has been exhausted. LTE-Advanced works via Carrier Aggregation using both 1800MHz and 2600 MHz bands to give you more consistent high speeds. As of today, Digi claims that their LTE-A network is the widest in the country, covering 31% of the population. To enjoy LTE-A speeds, you will need to have a 4G SIM, at least a Cat 6 device and be within their coverage area. If you meet these three criteria, any Digi customer can enjoy 4G LTE-A speeds regardless of whether you’re on a postpaid, prepaid or broadband plan. Digi also demonstrated their 4G LTE-A capabilities, reaching speeds of 100Mbps in the Taman Bukit Jalil area. If you’d like to see a map of Digi’s LTE and LTE-A coverage, head on over to their  ."

In China, the 20,000mAh power bank is going for 149 CNY which is about RM90, but we reckon it will be priced higher when it gets here.  The 2nd device is their   which now comes with a heart rate sensor. It looks the same as before but you’ll find an optical sensor underneath. Like the current version, it also tracks your steps, sleeping pattern and you can also use it to unlock your Mi smartphone when you’re within range. It is also IP67 resistant and this could probably last up to 30 days depending on your usage. The new Mi Band is priced at 99CNY which is about RM60.  With the Redmi Note 3 going on sale next week on 6 April, we are guessing that these 2 new products could go on sale on the same day as well. The Redmi Note 3 is priced at RM749 for the 2GB RAM + 16GB storage model, while the higher spec 3GB RAM + 32GB storage version is going for RM849. We’ll let you know once we have more details."

However, at the end of last year, we reported that there would be a   entering the scene in 2016 and it seems this could be it. We received an email invitation from   regarding a “P1 secret” that was due to be unveiled on the 13th of April 2016. Now, what could it possibly be?  Well, from the looks of things, it certainly seems like they’re going to officially announce their mobile 4G service. Since  ‘s acquisition of P1 in 2014, TM has worked towards developing P1 into their mobile arm and mobility centre, initially eyeing a 2015 launch of their mobile services. That initial plan didn’t come to fruition but it looks like their revised schedule of a 2016 entry will. TM has said that their overall LTE network rollout, the core of which is being managed by P1, was proceeding as planned so being able to meet their revised target of a 2016 launch may not come as such a surprise. This isn’t TM’s first foray into LTE technology as they launched their very own 4G broadband-only service TMgo back in 2015 which runs on 850MHz. TMgo was designed to replace TM’s older Wireless Streamyx on CDMA. What does TM’s entry into the 4G operator industry mean for us as consumers? Well, many good things we hope. More competition is always welcomed because it keeps the other telcos on their toes. A firm monopoly on any industry hurts us, the consumers, the most because it means that we’re at the mercy of whoever holds all the cards in that particular industry. Competition, on the other hand, means that these companies have to keep their plans competitive and try to undercut or trump the competition to attract consumers. A good example of this can be seen in the recent . With TM’s entry, things will surely get more interesting for the current four-way horse race as TM will be bringing in all their expertise and experience that they’ve accrued over the years to shake up the scene. How effective will they be as a telco? I guess we’ll have to wait to find out."

Today, they pulled back the covers on the Neffos C5 and C5L — two entry level smartphones with decent specs. Kicking things off is the higher spec Neffos C5. The C5 comes packing a 5-inch 720p HD display with a MediaTek MT6735 processor mated to 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable (via microSD up to 32GB) internal storage running on the inside. In the camera department the C5 comes with an 8MP primary camera mounted on the back while selfies are handled by a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. Giving the device juice is a 2,200 mAh battery. Moving on to the more entry-level of the two, the Neffos C5L features a 4.5-inch FWVGA display on the front. Inside, it’s powered by a Snapdragon 210 processor mated to 1GB of RAM and 8GB of expandable internal storage. For optics, the device gets the same 8-megapixel rear-facing camera as the more expensive C5, but the selfie shooter gets a slight bump down to 2MP. Keeping the lights on is a modest 2,000 mAh battery. Both devices will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop and have support for 4G LTE and dual-SIM capabilities. 
 It is unfortunate that TP-Link didn’t bring in the more powerful C5 Max as that device looked quite promising so we will just have to settle for these two for now. That said, there was a C5 Max on display but it was labeled “Coming soon”. If you want to pick one up for yourself, the Neffos C5 is priced at RM539 while the Neffos C5L will set you back RM359. Both devices will be available in pearl white and dark grey, and will go on sale online at   beginning 12th April. If you’re one of the first 100 customers to pick up either device, you will receive a free powerbank (worth RM99) and a screen protector."

Plus, it had a metal unibody — with some models even sporting a sophisticated diamond etched design — which is very rare at that price point. Now, Xiaomi has upped the ante with the Redmi 3 Pro, bumping up the RAM to 3GB while doubling the expandable internal storage to 32GB. It’s also got a fingerprint scanner mounted on the back of the device — similar to the Redmi Note 3 — but that also means that it loses its diamond-etch pattern. Besides that, the phone keeps all of its other specs including a 13-megapixel PDAF camera with an f/2.0 aperture lens and a 5MP front facing snapper. The Redmi 3 Pro will also have dual-SIM and microSD support (up to 128GB) via a hybrid-SIM tray. Keeping the 5-inch HD screen lit is a massive 4,100 mAh battery that should easily last an entire day.

Whether you’re travelling in an unfamiliar part of town, don’t want to worry about parking, or are just too tired to drive, Uber becomes your personal chauffeur. If you’ve been a little creative with your use of Uber, I’m sure you’ve probably discovered that you can have an Uber driver send stuff like a parcel or a birthday cake instead. Of course, this may come with complications as the Uber service isn’t exactly meant for stuff like this, but as there aren’t many services like that, many have had no choice but to use Uber. Well, that’s not the case anymore. Meet NeonRunner. Funky name aside, NeonRunner offers same-day delivery services for “almost anything that can fit in their waterproof 18″ x 18″ x 16″ insulated carrier box that is below 12kg”. That’s a pretty wide range of stuff, but you probably won’t be able to use them for furniture delivery. NeonRunner offers two separate services — the first being a buying service where they buy stuff and send it to you while the second is a delivery service where they pick up whatever package or parcel you have and sends it to your desired location. Within the delivery service, you also have the option to get NeonRunner to complete specific tasks for you like banking in a cheque or paying your bills. Requesting a delivery, purchase or task is fairly simple. Simply create/log in to your NeonRunner account and choose either BUY or DELIVER. Then, enter the location details, item descriptions (you can add a photo too) and contact information before hitting the “Request a runner button”. To the right of the order page you will see a floating window that gives you a total estimate fee to get the task, purchase or delivery done. In the fee breakdown, they charge an RM0.25/km Distance Fee plus a RM0.50/min Time Fee for both services. However, for the BUY service, NeonRunner charges you an RM5 + 3.5% of the purchased item Service Fee while the DELIVER option gets a flat RM3 Service Fee. This service is reminiscent of something like GoGet or MatDespatch, but the biggest difference is the method of payment. With GoGet, you will need to have cash ready when the delivery arrives while MatDespatch operates on a prepaid credit system. NeonRunner, on the other hand, is cashless (much like Uber). Simply input your card information and billing address and you’re good to go. Easy and hassle free, two things I believe are a necessity for people who require these services. Though, it is worth noting that the operation only runs from 10am to 10pm daily, so no midnight deliveries for you. NeonRunner also only operates within the Greater Kuala Lumper and Klang Valley area."

They have a large catalogue products ranging from personal mobility scooters to air purifiers. Now, they’re adding a new product to their roster — a rice cooker. Together with the launch of Xiaomi’s new sub-brand, the Mi Ecosystem, the Chinese company has unveiled the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker. Now   how you name a rice cooker. Like its name suggests, the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker is a WiFi-enabled rice cooker that is designed specifically to cook your rice in the best way possible. According to Xiaomi, their rice cooker follows the three concepts applied by expensive Japanese rice cookers to cook rice perfectly: Pressure control, heating method and the cooker’s lining material. The Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker employs a magnetic relief valve to precisely control the pressure in the rice cooker while using an electromagnetic heating technology for higher thermal efficiency and to ensure even cooking of the rice. It also uses a grey cast iron that has undergone a 69-step process to maintain an even heating and ensure strong thermal performance during use. The cast iron pot is coated with PFA powder to ensure that your rice doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot. Perhaps the most amazing feature of the Xiaomi rice cooker is the fact that you can scan a pack of rice with the Mi Home app to identify the type of rice, brand and origin. Then, based on that, the rice cooker can adjust its heating methodology to best suit that brand of rice so that the end result is a perfectly cooked pot of rice. Users can also customise the cooking and have their own preset preferences to cook the rice. It currently supports over 200 brands of rice but this support will be expanded in the future. As a cherry on top of the proverbial cake, the Mi Home app also comes with recipes that you can cook using the Mi Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker like brown rice, crispy rice and even cakes."

The duo got a bump in specs as well as a few nice new features. The Galaxy J5 was a rather underwhelming device from the get-go with a measly 1.5GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. With the Galaxy J5 (2016), Samsung has bumped the specs up by quite a bit. Now, it sports a larger 5.2-inch HD Super AMOLED panel on the front of the device with a 1.2GHz octa-core processor mated to 2GB OF RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Now with twice the storage, users start with 10.6GB of available storage compared to the old device’s 4.3GB of available storage. In the camera department, its got a 13MP f/1.9 primary camera mounted on the back plus a 5-megapixel f/1.9 selfie shooter with front-facing flash for those crucial low-light selfies. Keeping the lights on is a larger 3,100 mAh battery. Perched higher up the ladder is the bigger and more powerful Galaxy J7 (2016). Along with a larger 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED panel, the J7 (2016) also sports beefier internals with a 1.6GHz octa-core processor on the inside mated to 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. While the bump up in screen resolution to full-HD from the HD panel on the previous model is nice, the best part of this new model is the increased RAM — double that of the old J7’s 1.5GB. For photos, the Galaxy J7 (2016) sports the same optics as on the Galaxy J5 (2016) which should result in a similar photo-taking experience. Since it’s a bigger device, it also gets a bigger battery — rated at 3,300 mAh — which is also a bump up from the previous J7. The new Galaxy J duo also has support for microSD expansion (up to 128GB) and dual-SIM capabilities via a dedicated microSD card slot and dual-SIM slot. That means you don’t have to choose between 2 SIMs or 1 SIM and one microSD card. Besides that, these devices now have support for NFC which should mean pairing and mobile payments are now that much easier. They’ve also got a metal frame that should lend a more premium feel in your hand.   As a whole, the upgrades these devices received are definitely necessary as it helps them keep up with the other low-end good-value smartphones in the market. However, with this bump in specifications, it is likely that the duo will also be marketed at a higher price. These devices will soon see an official release in China, but there is currently no word on when the Galaxy J duo will see an international release or when they will arrive in Malaysia. With the upgraded specs on the J5 (2016) and J7 (2016), these entry-level Samsung devices actually have better internals than the South Korean company’s mid-range Galaxy A3 (2016) and Galaxy A5 (2016) smartphones. However, the Galaxy A series devices have a more premium build and finish (plus a fingerprint scanner on the A5) which does feel great in the hand. What do you think of these new Galaxy J devices?"

In terms of OS, it is currently running on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with a likely OxygenOS or HydrogenOS skin on top. There are no details on the screen size or battery capacity at this point. So far there’s also no visual clues either. From the specs, it looks quite similar to the  , which is currently the most affordable Snapdragon 820 smartphone.

All plans comes with unlimited quota and they are giving unlimited calls to all Maxis numbers. Each month you also get RM30 to call other domestic phone numbers. Can Maxpert make the difference? According to the site, their internet experts will not leave your home until everything is set up properly for the best experience. Hopefully, that also means no crappy wireless routers. They say they will scan in every room for possible wireless interference and make the necessary router adjustments for the best signal strength. Any new hardware required to ensure the best wireless connection will be chargeable though you won’t have to pay for it during the installation. Instead, the cost of the new hardware will be charged to your first month’s bill. For more info, visit the   product page."
Rory Lee,5 things that you may not know were designed by Malaysians,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/5-things-that-you-may-not-know-were-designed-by-malaysians/,"intel,Intel Compute Stick,Intel IoT gateway,Intel Malaysia,Intel Malaysia Design Centre,Intel NUC board,Internet of Things,Malaysia,Malaysia Design centre,Malaysians,USB 1.0 microcontroller","Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Others",2016-03-28,"“Buatan Malaysia” often gets a bad rap even in our own country. But, the truth is, there are many Malaysians out there making some seriously awesome stuff. In tech, we’re making big strides too especially when it comes to major breakthroughs with one of the largest chipmakers in the world — Intel. Here are five awesome technological advancements Malaysians have made with the chipmaker that you probably didn’t know about. Intel has put a big emphasis on Asia to help drive its growth in recent years. They established their first facility outside of the United States   in 1972. However, as the years went by, Intel nearly shut the facility down in 1991 as the micro-controller business wasn’t profitable back then. That obviously would have put the engineers that worked there in a tough spot so rather than give up, the engineers proposed that Intel keeps the business running by adding value with design work. Since then, the relatively small team of 30 engineers has now grown to over 2,000 engineers all working under what has become the Malaysia Design Centre (MDC). This meant that Malaysia was no longer just a hub for the production of hardware, but also a contributor to the research and development of new products and technological innovations. Over the years, the MDC, working under Intel, has conceived many innovative breakthroughs in technological development but we’re here to tell you about the five biggest ones that have made a pretty significant impact on the world we live in right now. [ ] I’m sure you’ve seen this little guy making its rounds. If you haven’t, the Intel Compute Stick basically offers the full desktop experience of a computer, in something that looks like an oversized pen drive. It’s small and easy to carry around, plus the ease of being able to just plug it into any HDMI-enabled TV or display and turn it into a full-fledged PC makes it pretty nifty. Perfect for school and college use. [ ] As we develop towards the miniaturisation of the PC, Mini PCs become the next stepping stone to that of the full sized tower desktops. Stuff like the Remix Mini   are often enough for most people and their daily tasks. At the forefront of Mini PC development is Intel with its NUC (Next Unit of Computing) line of computers. These are basically computer kits that come with a custom Intel motherboard and an Intel CPU plus slots in which you can install RAM and a hard drive yourself. Super compact, totally upgradable, and designed by Malaysians. [ ] Intel’s Atom processors can be found in many netbooks, 2-in-1s and even smartphones. As a product line, the Atom processor is often associated with relatively inexpensive or portable netbooks and smart devices, but did you know that the first purpose built Low Cost Intel Architecture based System on a Chip design (codenamed Pineview Intel Atom) came out of the MDC team? Pineview processors cover the N4xx, D4xx, N5xx, and D5xx processors, all of which came with integrated graphics while boasting improved performance and a 20% drop in power consumption compared to previous generations. This particular design propelled the growth of lightweight, compact and affordable netbook market, netting seven world-class manufacturing records before it was even launched in 2009. With modern computers, simply plugging and playing your pen drives, mice and keyboards among other things into the desktop’s USB ports is practically a norm. It is this convenience and seamless peripheral connectivity that the Malaysian designed USB 1.0 micro-controller has made possible. No hassle, no fuss, just plug and play. The Internet of Things is a fascinating notion that is becoming more and more complete as each day passes. Smart TVs, smart fridges, smart air purifiers, all contribute to the connectivity of objects with each other. But what about legacy objects that were conceived and created before the IoT was a thing? Well, the MDC designed Intel IoT Gateway is one of these solutions that helps companies connect these legacy devices to the Internet. The device and sensor management application is an end-to-end IoT solution that has been successfully applied to smart agriculture systems and across a range of industries including hospitality, asset tracking and industrial automation. These are truly amazing things that this home-grown team of engineers have accomplished since their inception. So, as the MDC celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, let’s all take our hats off to these awesome technologies and the Malaysians behind their design."
Rory Lee,HTC 10 to have a Snapdragon 652 variant,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/htc-10-to-have-a-snapdragon-652-variant/,"Android,HTC,HTC 10,HTC 10 leak,HTC 10 rumour,HTC 10 Snapdragon 652,HTC 10 Snapdragon 820,smartphone","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-03-28,"HTC’s 10 has been a hot topic of discussion lately. As information about the device trickles out, rumours regarding the device also start to heat up and one of the more interesting ones is that there may be two processor variants of the HTC 10 — a Snapdragon 820 variant and one that’s powered by a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor. That’s a pretty shocking jump in processing power no matter how you spin it. Although manufacturers have been known to release lower-end versions of their flagship devices, these devices often featuring either lower-clocked processors or slightly less RAM. HTC, on the other hand, seems to have gone down an interesting path with its choice of smartphone variants opting for a completely different SoC. This is pretty similar to the rumoured LG G5 “Lite” which is also a Snapdragon 652-powered G5. The low-spec HTC 10 is said to pack 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage to go along with the new Snapdragon chip. That’s quite a limited amount of space for a device bearing the flagship name — especially in 2016. On the other hand, the Snapdragon 820-powered devices are said to be packing either 3GB of RAM plus 32GB of storage or 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. HTC’s 10 does seem to pack a punch though as recent AnTuTu benchmarks reveal a   of 156.091 which completely beats everything else in the market right now. Considering this incredible performance, HTC must have worked some magic on their device’s optimisation because a similarly spec-ed Xiaomi Mi 5 is only capable of scoring 142,000 points. With this optimisation, it begs the question of how well the Snapdragon 652 variant would fair. We certainly wouldn’t expect another record-breaking score, but it should be pretty interesting to see. What is a little troubling to see is the rumoured price that the HTC 10 is said to retail at. According to  , the Snapdragon 652 variant will be priced at CNY3,799 (around RM2,343) while the higher Snapdragon 820 variants will be priced at CNY4,999 (around RM3,083) and CNY5,888 (around RM3,631). Other specifications rumoured for the HTC 10 are a 5.1-inch Quad HD   display, a   camera, a large 3,000 mAh battery and a new kind of   audio experience. How many variants HTC will really launch and what will be powering each device still remains unconfirmed so take it with a grain of salt. The good news is that the wait won’t be much longer as all will be   on 12th April 2016."

The Galaxy S7 edge is tied with 24 months contract of Super 168 postpaid plan   at RM168/month subscription fee. The plan gives you 2,000 minutes of calls and 2,000 SMS (within Yes network via Yes Life app) plus 20GB of internet each month.  In addition, you’ll also get the Huddle XS MiFi device worth RM509 for free and an extra 32GB memory card but there’s no mention what type it is. During registration, Yes requires a rather steep RM1,888 upfront payment which will be rebated back to your account over 24 months. So that’s a total of RM2,687 you’ll need to fork out before 6% GST.  : The RM88/month subscription fee isn’t a promo. It is the price (before GST) after deducting the monthly RM1,888 rebate. In total, you will be paying RM168 for 24 months (excluding GST), which comes up to RM4,032 overall just for subscription fees. RM168 for 20GB is quite expensive considering they are currently offering   on a shorter 12-month contract."
Rory Lee,OPPO Malaysia CEO teases F1 Plus — looks exactly like the R9,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/oppo-malaysia-ceo-teases-f1-plus-looks-exactly-like-the-r9/,"Malaysia,Oppo,OPPO F1,OPPO F1 Plus,OPPO R9,OPPO R9 Plus,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo,Rumour Mill",2016-03-28,"has been known, especially with their recent smartphones, to stick to a similar design language when it comes to new devices. Just take a look at the   compared to the   series of smartphones — they’re nearly identical. However, the keyword here is “nearly”, as there are some noticeable physical features that separate the two smartphones. If we’re looking at the recent slew of photos shared by OPPO Malaysia CEO William Fang of the supposed  , the same distinction can’t be made because it looks   like the newly announced  . There’s no denying it, it’s identical from the rounded camera hump all the way to the front mounted fingerprint sensor. What’s peculiar here is that when the F1 Plus was   in Mumbai early this year, there was no mention of a fingerprint scanner at all. You would think that a fingerprint scanner on what should likely be a mid-range device to be a big deal, but there was no mention of it in the slides. It could then simply be a home button, but that seems unlikely. With smartphones that share a similar design, it isn’t too uncommon for companies to sometimes get them mixed up, so it is possible that William simply made a mistake. But, with each subsequent post, it seems more and more likely that this isn’t a mix-up and could indeed be the F1 Plus. If it isn’t a mix-up, what could it be then? Our guess is that the F1 Plus could be a rebranding of the R9. They line up in terms of specs with a 5.5-inch full HD display and 4GB of RAM, but we can’t say for certain as no further specifications have been revealed. Earlier, we reported that OPPO Malaysia was   the R9 to Malaysia a month after the device’s   on the 17th of March. However, with OPPO Malaysia’s latest teaser posted on their Facebook page, it seems more likely that the next device that they’re launching is the F1 Plus. So this opens up the question: Will the R9 be arriving in Malaysia as the F1 Plus? To us, the name doesn’t really matter as long as the device is solid. What do you guys think?"
Rory Lee,HP Pavilion x2 review: A capable supplementary device,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/23/hp-pavilion-x2-review-a-capable-supplementary-device/,,,2016-03-23,"2-in-1s are pretty popular these days because they provide the convenience of a tablet plus the productivity capabilities of a full-fledged laptop. Granted, most of them can’t permanently replace a dedicated laptop or computer, but they’re good enough for work that you can leave your heavy laptop at home and bring a space-aged tablet hybrid around with you. HP’s Pavilion x2 is one that fits into that hybrid laptop category and I quite like it despite some of its obvious drawbacks. There’s no denying that it’s a handsome device. Closed or open, it will look good on any dream desk as it looks very modern and fairly premium despite its plastic construction. That said, you should be extra careful with the white version because that picks up quite a bit of dirt over time. You can tell that thought was put into the construction of the device when you look at the hinge. When the device is open, the screen rolls out and elevates the keyboard, giving you better ergonomics than a flat keyboard. Plus, the magnets holding the tablet to the keyboard are quite strong, letting you lift the device without worry of either part coming off. Since we’re on the topic of the keyboard, it does give a nice typing experience. For something so small and compact, the keys are well spaced and give great travel when typing. I had no problems typing on it for a full day despite coming from a mechanical keyboard."
Rory Lee,Compared: Fibre broadband services in Malaysia — TM vs TIME vs Maxis,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/28/compared-fibre-broadband-services-in-malaysia-tm-vs-time-vs-maxis/,"best fibre broadband malaysia,fibre broadband comparison,Fibre broadband comparison Malaysia,Malaysia,Maxis,Maxis fibre comparison,Maxis MaxisONE Home fibre,TIME,Time Fibre,TIME fibre comparison,TM,TM Unifi,TM UniFi comparison","Industry in General,Maxis,Players on the Field,Time,TM,UniFi",2016-03-28,"We’ve updated the comparison to include TM’s new  . After the initial  , it seems the battle has spilt over into the realm of fixed broadband services as the big-three fibre broadband service providers in Malaysia clash. The question is, which one is the best for you? Don’t worry because, as usual, we’ve got you covered. 
 We saw strong offerings from the three major players in the fibre broadband industry, but as with most plans, there are pros and cons to each plan. TM kicked things off by upping their UniFi game to the current   which offers 30Mbps download speeds for RM179. If you desire more speed, you can opt for the upgrade to 50Mbps for RM50 extra. TM also have a new UniFi Pro plan that offers speeds up to 100Mbps. Much like the original VIP UniFi plans, you will also get a free HyppTV subscription though only for the base channels. If you’re a big TV or movie buff, TM’s UniFi also offers a 1-year free subscription to local streaming service iflix worth RM96. With iflix, you get access to a moderately large catalogue of old and some relatively new shows that you can binge, including exclusives like Mr Robot. Opting for the UniFi Pro plan gives you additional benefits on top of those that you get with the UniFi Advance plans. Firstly, the UniFi Pro plan comes with a free Voice Call voice bundle (worth RM20) that gives you 600 mins of calls, beyond which you will be charged 10sen/min to mobile and other fixed lines (calls to TM fixed lines remain free). You also get a free 3-month access pass to Viu — a streaming site that offers Korean dramas, varriety shows and other asian programs. There is a caveat, however. With UniFi Advance and Pro, your download and upload speeds are not symmetrical, meaning for the base RM179 plan, you will be getting 30Mbps download speeds but only 10Mbps upload speeds. The same goes for the 50Mbps which have its upload speed limited to 20Mbps and the 100Mbps Pro plan which has it’s upload speeds limited to 50Mbps. Do keep in mind that these prices for the UniFi Advance and Pro plans are still under a promo price (original prices: RM199 (30Mbps), RM249 (50Mbps), RM329 (100Mbps) so the original prices are a tad higher. While TM has extended the promotional period for the UniFi Advance plans in the past, it remains unclear if they will do so for the “early bird promo” price for the UniFi Pro plan. , on the other hand, released their   of broadband services with symmetrical speeds of up to 500Mbps for RM299. If you don’t want to pay the premium for 500Mbps, they also have lower tier plans rated at 100Mbps and 300Mbps that costs RM149 and RM189 respectively. With TIME, you don’t get many luxuries in terms of add-ons, just raw Internet speed. In this aspect, TIME is unmatched by the other local fibre broadband operators, but, they have their hands tied when it comes to coverage as TIME’s services only extend to 250,000 ports nationwide. Most of TIME’s ports can be found in apartments and condos so if you’re living on a landed property, odds are, you won’t be able to subscribe to TIME.  are notorious for not participating in price wars, instead, opting to improve customer service and reliability. With that in mind, Maxis launched their latest   broadband plans which focus on customer service and installation experience. What they’ve come up with is the Maxperts which, in their own words. are a “SWAT-like team of Internet experts” who specialise in optimising your Internet connection. We can see how this is useful for those who are less than tech-savvy, but if you are anything like us, the services these Maxperts provide become much less valuable as you could probably do the optimising yourself. In true Maxis fashion, their fibre plans are the most expensive in this comparison. For the base 20Mbps plan, Maxis are charging RM170/month while the 30Mbps plan is going for RM220/month. You will also have to be subscribed to a MaxisONE Plan (excluding the MaxisONE Plan Lite) before you are eligible to subscribe to the MaxisONE Home. To make matters worse, the prices mentioned above are after a special promo discount for MaxisONE Plan 128 and above customers. That means, if you’re a MaxisONE Plan 98 subscriber, you will still have to pay the full price of RM198 for 20Mbps, RM270 for 30Mbps and RM398 for 100Mbps. Speaking of the 100Mbps plan, this plan is only available within Maxis’ own area of coverage (which reaches 75,000 ports) and does not extend to the ports they share with TM. Besides that, you will have to be a MaxisONE Plan 158, 188, MaxisONE Business and MaxisONE Business Extra to be eligible for the RM330/month price. In all honesty, these three companies aren’t exactly direct competitors because (especially in the case of TIME) you either have one or the other. Besides Maxis and TM, these services rarely overlap. That said, it is worth taking a look at who can provide the most well-rounded package out there. If it was up to me and I could choose between these three services, I would pick TIME. I’m a heavy Internet user so all I care about is Internet speed and stability — I don’t need all the extra goodies like IPTV bundles and calls or streaming subscriptions. But, I’m willing to bet that not many share my usage habits. So, if I were to consider the average household — including family members, guests, children, etc. — TM’s UniFi Advance and Pro plans provide the most well-rounded fibre experience. They’ve got iflix (which my mum loves to watch old movies on), clear free-to-air TV channels (which my dad loves), and a fast enough download speed + low latency for my gaming needs. A decent compromise that will probably tick the most boxes for the average family. Which plan would you pick?"

It seems the pull of taking a slice out of the smartphone market was simply too strong for the computer networking manufacturer to resist. Branded Neffos, TP-Link launched three different Android devices under the Neffos C5 line — the C5L, C5, and C5 Max. Starting things off is the smallest of them all, the C5L.

Alexander Wong,Maxis is the leading mobile network in Malaysia according to OpenSignal’s report,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/25/maxis-is-the-leading-mobile-network-in-malaysia-according-to-opensignal/,"4G LTE,4G LTE Malaysia,Celcom,Celcom 4G,DiGi,DiGi 4G,Malaysia 4G LTE,Maxis,Maxis 4G,Maxis 4G coverage,Open Signal,OpenSignal,U Mobile,U Mobile 4G","Celcom,DiGi,Maxis,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-03-25,"Postpaid plans in Malaysia are   with competitive telcos dishing out more data for your money. Apart from cost, another crucial factor to consider is network quality. What’s the point of getting loads of data on the cheap if you can’t use it when you needed it the most? 4G LTE was introduced in Malaysia back in 2013 and currently we have 4 major LTE telcos – Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. To find out which network is best, OpenSignal has just published a State of Mobile Networks report specifically for Malaysia. The findings were derived from a data sample size of close to 40 million that were contributed by 21,109 OpenSignal app users in Malaysia between 1 December 2015 to 29 February 2016.  According to OpenSignal, Maxis gets their top pick for having the best 4G coverage and best speed in Malaysia. From their report over a 3 month period, Maxis users are connected to 4G LTE 70% of the time. Since Maxis customers are having 4G more frequently, this also brings up the overall network speed to first place with an average of 5.20Mbps. For 4G specifically, Maxis delivers an average speed of 13Mbps. Out of the 4 telcos, Celcom is ranked the worst due to lower network speeds and higher latency on both 3G and 4G. They noted that Celcom’s performance was better around the Klang Valley area. When compared to the global average, Malaysia’s 4G LTE speed is quite close to the standard average of 13.5Mbps.   To measure 4G coverage, OpenSignal uses the time coverage methodology which calculates the proportion of time a user is connected on 4G. This gives a better measurement especially when you could be getting just 3G indoors while being in a 4G covered area.  As seen on the chart above, Maxis leads at first place at 69.98% followed by Digi at 57.60%. Celcom takes third place at 52.94%, while U Mobile is last at 44.23%. U Mobile obviously takes a beating here as it relies on Maxis for 2G/3G coverage where their network is not available.  When looking at speed, U Mobile is the fastest in both 3G and 4G specifically. However, it takes 2nd place overall as most of it users are connected to 3G most of the time. Despite that, it is worth noting that U Mobile is faster overall than Digi and Celcom which has more 4G LTE sites in comparison.  Celcom, unfortunately, ranks the slowest among the four in any given scenario.  Maxis and U Mobile are the top picks for 3G with a latency of less than 105ms. Meanwhile for 4G, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile have a 3-way draw with less than 56ms. The lower the latency indicates a more responsive network and unfortunately, Celcom trails behind for both 3G and 4G segments.  To conclude, OpenSignal’s latest report ranks Maxis as the better network for overall 4G LTE availability, speeds and latency. This is contrary to what   their website earlier on.  For this year, we can expect our telcos to push for more 4G coverage aggressively particularly Maxis and Digi. Both telcos will be refarming their 2G 1800MHz spectrum for 4G use. On top of that, both are also pushing for more LTE-A sites which provide even faster speeds with carrier aggregation.  If OpenSignal’s report is an accurate indicator, Celcom has a lot of room to improve. With its value-for-money FIRST postpaid plans, the blue telco has the pulling power to draw other subscribers to their fold. To expand and to upgrade a 4G network is a costly affair. There are concerns whether affordable plans with loads of data can sustain telcos in the long run. If you haven’t seen it yet, you can check out our   post.

It’s something you can do on most navigation applications and it allows you to have quick access to your favourite destinations. In a recent update,   added a little feature that’ll add some pizzazz to your navigation experience. Google Maps now lets you put stickers on your Work and Home saved locations. These stickers range from igloos to barn houses so if you’re bored of what your current house looks like, at least, you can now change what you see on your navigation app. This is a cute personalisation gesture that I will surely mess around with at least for awhile, but pretty stickers aren’t the only thing Google added to their navigation app. Maps now also lets you add labels to your favourite destinations like the gym, school or underground bowling alley that you frequent. Again, this gives you a degree of personalisation and customisation on the experience you want to have when navigating with the app, rather than actually functionality. This is because you can simply save a location by tapping the “Save” button with the golden star and it will turn up in “Your places” when you pull out the hamburger menu. I suppose the biggest benefit is if you give a place with a complicated name a simple nickname or code via the label. All you have to do then is type label or nickname into the app’s search bar (for example, AMPM Cafe is labelled Mmm Yummy in my Maps) and the location will appear at the top of the search results. Pretty nifty quality of life changes, but nothing too radical from what we can tell. Well, except the fact that you can change your house into a flippin’ dragon whenever you want to and that’s pretty awesome if you ask me."
Alexander Wong,3 reasons why the iPhone SE is a big deal,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/22/3-reasons-why-the-iphone-se-is-a-big-deal/,"apple,Apple iPhone SE,iPhone,iPhone 6,iPhone 6 Malaysia,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Plus,iphone malaysia,iPhone SE,iPhone SE Malaysia,iPhone SE Price","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-03-22,"Early this morning Apple had   its latest iPhone that’s simply called the  . It is a brand new model and it doesn’t even have a number on it. In the past, the cheapest iPhone you can buy is basically a rehash of an outdated model with a smaller storage option. We’ve seen this since the  /  days. That’s no longer the case with the iPhone SE. It is Apple’s most affordable new iPhone and it’s just as powerful as their current flagship. Smartphones these days are getting bigger and we’ve seen how Apple has succumbed to this trend when they introduced a larger 4.7” iPhone 6 and a phablet-sized 5.5″ Plus model. Of course not everybody wants a bigger phone. In 2015, Apple is still   over 30 million iPhones with a 4” screen which included the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. Well, it isn’t a huge chunk considering that’s only 13% of its total 231.5 million iPhones sold, but nevertheless it is still quite a significant number. Remember the ad above? It is still relevant today and there are people who are   to their old iPhone 5/5S because of the size. Try tapping the “back” button on the larger iPhones and you’ll get what I mean. The iPhone SE looks exactly like an iPhone 5S and you can even have it in Rose Gold. Underneath that familiar 4” 1136×640 Retina display, the iPhone SE is just as good as the current iPhone 6s. In fact, they are calling it the most powerful 4-incher yet. It gets the same top notch iPhone 6s performance with a 64-bit A9 chip and it also packs the same 12MP iSight camera with dual-tone LED flash, Live Photos and it also shoot videos in 4K. Over at the front, it settles for the same old 1.2MP camera as the iPhone 6/5S but it supports Retina Flash for brighter selfies. Connectivity wise, the iPhone SE will work with a wider range of LTE networks and it also comes with NFC support for Apple Pay. Our fluctuating exchange rates have made Apple products ridiculously expensive in Malaysia. You would have to fork out more than RM3,000 for the latest iPhone and that’s for the pathetic 16GB model. The iPhone SE is probably the best alternative for Apple to reach out to the mid-range segment. It packs flagship hardware at Apple’s “entry-level” price range. Make no mistake, Apple isn’t doing a Xiaomi but it is pretty much like how Sony does their Xperia Z compact line. In fact, there are rumours suggesting that Samsung will counter the SE with a compact Galaxy S7. The iPhone SE is very likely to be priced from under RM2,000 when it gets to Malaysia. This enables those on a budget to enjoy the very latest hardware from Apple. In Singapore, the iPhone SE 16GB is   at S$658 (RM1,954), which is lower than the iPhone 5S 16GB at S$728 (RM2,162). It is also the same in  , with the iPhone SE 16GB priced at A$679 (RM2,083) versus the iPhone 5S 16GB at A$749 (RM2,298). Before the iPhone 5S was removed from the Malaysian online store, the 16GB model is going for RM2,199 while the 32GB version is priced at RM2,499. The above table is our iPhone SE price estimate which shouldn’t stray too far from our southern neighbour. Let’s hope our RM doesn’t slide further against the US Dollar. Pre-orders are starting this week in first wave countries and the iPhone SE should reach Malaysia latest by end of May 2016. If you’ve been eyeing for an iPhone 6 16GB, forget that and get the iPhone SE 64GB instead. Yes, it is a smaller phone but you get better specs, better camera and most importantly 4X the storage. Trust us, you definitely need more than 16GB on an iPhone."
Rory Lee,Fitbit Blaze and Alta have hit local shores,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/22/fitbit-blaze-and-alta-have-hit-local-shores/,"FitBit,Fitbit Alta,Fitbit Alta Malaysia,Fitbit blaze,Fitbit Blaze Malaysia,FitBit malaysia,Fitness tracker Malaysia,Harvey Norman","Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Smart Watch",2016-03-22,"has made waves in the smartwatch industry despite not being technically a smartwatch. While their wearables have not been the prettiest of devices, they’ve always offered a pretty reasonable set of functions for the price. Early this year, Fitbit was determined to shore up that weakness too, launching the   and the   — both of which look pretty good on anyone’s wrist. Now, sticking to initial launch plans, these two wearables have finally hit our shelves. What sets the Blaze apart from the highest end  ? Well, for starters, it looks a whole lot better if you ask me. It has a much sleeker and classier look to it compared to the chunky Surge, which means that it’ll go well with almost every occasion. It’s also got a colour LED touch screen — a first for the wearable maker. It also pushes notifications like call, text and calendar alerts to your wrist from your smartphone. You can also control music playback and is also sweat and water resistant though no IP rating is given. What’s more, it’ll feature Fitbit’s SmartTrack which automatically recognises and records exercises for you. You can also pop out the head and swap it with another strap if elastomer is not your thing. However, it does lack one big feature from the Surge that fitness enthusiasts will undoubtedly miss — built-in GPS. Fitbit says it has “connected GPS” but that’s just a fancy term for saying “you need your smartphone to track distance and route”. Boo. Still, that has allowed Fitbit to keep the battery life on this device to 5 days but is admittedly shorter than the 7-day Surge battery life. Nevertheless, Fitbit is also placing it at a lower price point in their food chain, with the Blaze   RM950 (incl GST) — comes in Black and Plum colours — meaning that the Fitbit Surge still sits on top as the apex predator. As far as bands go, here’s the full catalogue on Harvey Norman: The Alta is two down from the Blaze in terms of its position in the Fitbit family, slotting in right between the   and the  . As a result, it has much less functionality but gets many of the core features right. It’ll track your activity all day, remind you to move and automatically records your activities via SmartTrack. It’ll also track your sleep and double as a clock plus push notifications like call, text and calendar alerts (something the Charge HR doesn’t do). However, it does lack an altimeter and a heart-rate sensor, but there’s really only so much you can cram into such a small form-factor. It looks pretty sleek and stylish which means that this little wristband-like smart wearable should fit in any occasion. If you’re interested, the Fitbit Alta is   now at RM630 (incl GST) and comes in three colours — Blue, Black and Plum. Neither tickle your fancy? Take a gander at our  ."

However, thanks to a reliable source, Zinggadget got hold of the official price for the new handset, and perhaps to nobody’s surprise, the device is priced below RM1,000. The media were given a briefing last Thursday (24th March) regarding the device, as well as given some time with the smartphone, but the details for the pricing as well as which variant of the smartphone Xiaomi were bringing into Malaysia were not revealed. Instead, we were told to hang on to our hats and wait for the official launch to find out. But, in what looks like a dinner of some sort for the potential resellers of the Redmi Note 3, a slide containing the price and a fact sheet for the Malaysian Redmi Note 3 model were leaked. Based on the images posted by  , Xiaomi is bringing in the version with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable (up to 32GB via microSD) storage. What’s more, the device looks to be priced at RM849, placing it right in the crosshairs of the honor 5X. Other specifications include a 5.5-inch full-HD IPS display on the front, with a Snapdragon 650 hexa-core processor running on the inside. For optics, the smartphone gets 16-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera with PDAF plus a 5MP front-facing snapper for selfies. Encasing the respectable internals is a full-metal unibody — the first for a Xiaomi device. It’s also sporting Xiaomi’s first ever rear-mounted fingerprint sensor placed right below the camera, as well as a large 4,050 mAh battery. It will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box and yes, this time there might actually be a retail box. In case you didn’t pick up on it earlier, the images look to have come from a retailer’s dinner hosted by Xiaomi which means that they might actually be using physical retail stores to sell their smartphone too — not just online. Besides that, if you look at the bottom right of the spec-sheet image, you’ll see Thorus Technology listed as an authorised reseller. This is pretty rare for the Chinese company but we believe it could be because the Online market has reached its peak and Xiaomi has hit their saturation point for online sales. Even in China, Xiaomi is working with big retail brands to sell their devices on the shelf so it might not be surprising if they decided to do so here as well. What do you guys think of this move by Xiaomi? Would you pick up the Redmi Note 3 from a physical store or stick to the online store? And of course, what do you think about the RM849 asking price for the handset? Let us know in the comments below. Thanks   for the tip!"

How else do they get away with selling everything they do as a reinvention of technology? It’s as uncanny as it is amazing and while you either hate Apple or love them, you can’t help but admire how well they get people to eat out of their hands. Take their latest device, the  , for instance. When Cupertino revealed it, I was blown away because it was the single most brilliant but dumb thing they’ve done. Apple’s March 2016 Keynote special event was by no means a large event, in fact, it was almost intimate as far as mobile launches go. Many, including us, weren’t expecting too much from them because they don’t usually make big announcements this early in the year. However, we were still holding out hope for some other kind of mobile accessory like a reinvented pair of VR goggles or a completely innovative 360-camera. Instead, what we got was a hint that Apple may be losing grip on their “world-changing” ways. All that the most valuable brand in the world had to show for their March Keynote was a  , an even   trapped in a body of a three-year-old smartphone and some  . Has one of the largest tech companies in the world nothing else to show at an internationally broadcasted event but a “new” iPad and iPhone? It honestly looked a little like Apple were shaken by how good their competitors have gotten and simply told   to throw something together out of spare parts. They could have done something as simple as tweak the design of the iPhone SE and it would have made all the difference. Instead, the only way you can tell the iPhone SE apart from the three-year-old 5s is that it weighs 1g more and comes in rose gold. It seems that Apple is resorting to rehashing an old device just to keep up with the competition. Of course, you could argue: Why fix something that isn’t broken? But that’s not what Apple does. Apple prides themselves with breaking the mould and not only improving existing tech but also “reinventing” it. With the iPhone SE, Apple had instead shown that even they can’t keep innovating. I say this because none of that matters. The main point of the iPhone SE is that now more people can buy iPhones. With the iPhone SE, not only are loyal customers who have previously hung on to old 4-inch iPhones going to have a viable upgrade, it’s also cheap. Well, cheap by Apple’s standards. But if you want an iPhone, Apple’s standards are the only standards you need to live by. So, instead of looking at a rehashed smartphone, people see an affordable and small iPhone with flagship-level performance. It doesn’t matter that it looks exactly like the iPhone 5s, or that it’s probably made using the same stuff. Nor does it matter that Apple had the audacity to put a rudimentary 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera on a 2016 smartphone that costs nearly RM2,000. What matters is that Apple found a need for a small, powerful yet affordable iPhone and are now owning that need."

Alexander Wong,Compared: Samsung Galaxy S7 edge telco plans in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/21/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-celcom-digi-maxis-u-mobile-comparison/,"Celcom,DiGi,Galaxy S7 edge celcom,Galaxy S7 edge maxis,Galaxy S7 edge U mobile,Maxis,price comparison,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Celcom,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge comparison,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge digi,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge maxis,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge telco comparison,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge u mobile,samsung malaysia,Telco Comparison,U Mobile","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-03-21,"The   is the best flagship smartphone you can buy at the moment with a retail price of RM3,099. If you’re planning to get one on contract, it is also available from the big 4 telcos ( ,  ,   and  ) in Malaysia. So which offers the better deal? And should you also consider getting one with the Maxis Zerolution or Celcom NewPhone program?  We’ve crunched the numbers, so read on for our Galaxy S7 edge price plan comparison. 
 Across the board, all telcos are offering 24-month contracts for the Galaxy S7 edge. The only exception is Celcom, with a shorter 12-month option for its higher FIRST Gold plan. With the ongoing postpaid price war, Celcom is the most competitive of the lot. Celcom’s FIRST Blue postpaid comes with 4GB of data at RM45/month, while the FIRST Gold plan packs 10GB for only RM80/month. For Digi, they are offering the Galaxy S7 edge with their new Postpaid plans that come in either More Internet or More Voice and SMS. The new plan offers RM20 off for those who sign up with their Postpaid 98, 148 and 238 (More Talk and SMS) plans before 30th June 2016. However, this offer isn’t applicable with the Galaxy S7 edge bundle. Fortunately, they are still giving extra 2GB data quota for its More Internet option.  During registration, Digi also requires you to pay 1-month advance subscription on top of the device upfront payment. Alternatively, you can sign up for a 0% EPP via credit card to pay no cash upfront during registration.  Maxis is still the most expensive option for postpaid contract. The entry level MaxisONE Plan 98 offers unlimited calls and SMS but it comes with just 1GB of data. It simply pales in comparison to Digi and Celcom that offers 10X more data for less. On the highest MaxisONE Plan 188, they are giving 1GB extra data for the first 6 months.  U Mobile did stir up the competition with its Hero Postpaid plan. Unfortunately, you can only get the Galaxy S7 edge with their Ultimate Device Plan. The plan isn’t as value-for-money compared to Hero Postpaid but you do get a decent device subsidy as the S7 edge is being offered from as low as RM1,799. The upfront payment can be waived if you pay for the device via credit card and opt in for their auto debit billing service. Instead of getting the Galaxy S7 on Ultimate Device Plan 135, we think it is more worth it to buy the Galaxy S7 edge outright and sign on with their P70 Hero Plan. This comes out to RM4,779 (before GST) for a 24-month subscription (RM1,680) and the device (RM3,099). Are you the type that loves to switch phones every year? You might want to consider Maxis’ Zerolution or Celcom’s NewPhone. Both lets you own the device with monthly instalments and the option to swap to a newer phone every 12 months.  
 
 For the phone swap to work, you are required to return your existing device in pristine condition. So to avoid any possible penalties, the device protection program not only gives you a better peace of mind, but also ensures a seamless upgrade when the time comes.  For Maxis, Zerolution lets you pick up a device with no upfront payment plus you have the freedom to opt out from the Zerolution upgrade. For example, if you do plan to keep the device, you can choose not to pay RM30/month for the Zerolution upgrade fee. On the downside, Zerolution is only available on its MaxisONE Plans which is quite costly.  On Celcom’s NewPhone program, you have the flexibility to go with any Celcom postpaid plan of your choice including its affordable FIRST Blue postpaid plan. Unlike Maxis, you’re required to pay an upfront payment according to the plan (e.g. FIRST Blue – RM150, FIRST Gold – RM80). A downside to NewPhone is that they lump the monthly instalment and the “upgrade” fee together. So if you plan to keep your phone, there’s no option to opt out from the upgrade and you have to pay the same monthly instalment across 24 months. Another advantage for Celcom NewPhone is that you can switch phones earlier but there’s an Express NewPhone fee that can go as high as RM1,000.  For the comparison above, we compare based on the assumption that you would make an upgrade after 12 months. Note that for the second year, it all depends on whether you will keep the same phone or switch to a newer device. If you do change to another smartphone, the instalment amount would be different.  Before signing up, we recommend picking a plan that would fulfil your needs. You can study your current bill and data usage to get a better idea of how much you really need each month.  Other factors to consider is the network coverage and quality in your area. Not all networks are built the same and the experience may vary depending on location. If you’re happy with your current provider, it might be a better idea to stick with them.  As usual, if you spot any errors in the tables above, please do let us know in the comments below."
Sponsored,Battle of the Sixes: The Nexus 6P versus the Apple iPhone 6s Plus versus the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/21/battle-of-the-sixes-the-nexus-6p-versus-the-apple-iphone-6s-plus-versus-the-samsung-galaxy-s6-edge/,,,2016-03-21,"When the Nexus 6P came out, the question on everyone’s lips was: “Is it as good as the other flagships?”. Aptly named the 6P, it seems that 2015 was the year of the six-branded smartphone, as the Nexus 6P, together with the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ and the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, carved a “holy-trinity” out of the smartphone crop. With these three priced at the top of the food chain as no-nonsense, no-compromise, best-phablets-money-can-buy devices, consumers everywhere were torn. The line separating these three devices were so thin that no matter which device you chose, you would end up with a great phablet nonetheless. But, c’mon, we have to crown a winner. There is only one sport at the top of that podium, and today we fill it. These devices are monsters when it comes to performance. They’re absolutely savage, devouring applications, multitasking, gaming, media consumption and everything else you can throw at it. They are the ultimate devices after all. But, like we said, there can only be one winner so we delve into the depths of multitasking and intense usage to try and find a winner. For a full list of specifications, please refer to our last page where we have a detailed table letting you know all the nitty gritty details of each device. First up is the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+. It has Samsung’s Exynos 7420 processor, powering it through daily activities. Multitasking was smooth and it had no problems munching up the slew of applications and games we threw at it. Next, we fired up the iPhone 6s Plus and gave it the beans too. Switching between apps was ridiculously quick and snappy. It did help that iOS’s animations made everything so much more fluid (like what Windows Phone does) and as if it was instantaneous. Some might call it cheating, we call it proper optimisation. Finally came the Nexus 6P. Two words: Stock Android. Fantastic multitasking experience, launching every application we could find and flipping through the multitasking card window as we wondered what application to flip between was lots of fun. It handled the switches like a champ. Android’s multitasking animation easily takes the cake. For gaming, well, is there a word to describe something that is buttery-er than buttery? In conclusion, when it comes to performance and multitasking, the iPhone 6s Plus snags the win by a hair over the Nexus 6P. The gap between the two and the Galaxy S6 edge+ though is a little further than expected. Somehow the home button on the Samsung device had a little delay when exiting applications."
Rory Lee,Here’s how you can use two SIMs and a microSD card on your Galaxy S7 edge,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/21/heres-how-you-can-use-two-sims-and-a-microsd-card-on-your-galaxy-s7-edge/,"Android,Dual Sim,dual sim hack,dual sim mod,Galaxy S7 edge mod,hybrid SIM,microSD,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Malaysia,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-03-21,"brought many of the features their fans loved in old Galaxy S devices — like the microSD card slot and water resistance — back to their flagship   model. The microSD card is an important feature but Samsung decided to go with a hybrid SIM tray which meant users had to choose between two SIMs or one SIM and one microSD card. What if we told you that you could have two SIMs   a microSD card slot? No Replied figured out a way to “hack” the hybrid SIM tray in the  , allowing them to use two nano SIMs and one microSD card at the same time. You must be thinking, how on earth do you “hack” hardware? Well, apparently you hack it literally because what No Replied did was chop up the secondary SIM and superglue it to the back of the microSD card. Brilliant right? The steps No Replied too seemed simple enough with the trickiest part, we reckon, to be the removal of the chip from the nano SIM. It involves heat, prying and some luck to safely get your chip out of its plastic body. Once that’s done though, the rest looks pretty simple and the result actually looks pretty slick and elegant. Clearly, if you’re going to chop up your SIM card, you should really be careful and we will not be held responsible for any damage caused by this little hack. Proceed at your own risk. If you’re interested in “hacking” your hybrid SIM tray, you can check out No Replied’s step-by-step guide  . Since it’s a mod to your SIM and microSD, it looks like this might work on any hybrid SIM tray."

It will also have a 5 MP front camera with a 13 MP rear snapper. The Galaxy J7 is also rumoured to ship with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow under the hood and will be home to a 3,300mAh battery.

Rory Lee,The Apple iPhone SE is the most powerful 4-inch phone ever,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/22/the-apple-iphone-se-is-the-most-powerful-4-inch-phone-ever/,"4-inch iPhone,apple,Apple iPhone SE,Apple Keynote March 2016,iOS,iPhone SE,smartphone","Apple,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-03-22,"has welcomed a new iPhone to their smartphone family — the   — and it’s a 4-inch device designed for people who simply love smaller iPhones. It’s packing a whole lot of horsepower that makes it the “most powerful 4-inch phone ever”. At the heart of the iPhone SE (pronounced “essay” apparently) sits Apple’s powerful A9 chip and M9 motion coprocessor. This means that the device has the same amount of performance as their iPhone 6s flagship device. This 4-inch smartphone also features Apple’s Retina display, boasting a pixel density of 326 ppi. That’s a mighty little device if we’ve ever seen one. What’s more, the iPhone SE will pack the excellent 12-megapixel iSight camera with Focus Pixels and a True Tone flash. To ensure the best camera experience, the iPhone SE also sports the A9’s new image signal processor which should ensure excellent photos. On the front though, things aren’t so pretty as the FaceTime HD camera is only capable of taking 1.2-megapixel images. One of the biggest complaints we’ve heard from our readers (and apparently every other iPhone 5s customer) was its terrible battery life. Well the iPhone SE is supposed to bring an improvement to battery performance, despite all that extra horsepower, which should keep you running for longer. It also has support for, faster LTE (50% faster than iPhone 5s), VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and faster 802.11ac WiFi connectivity. It’s also got Touch ID to ensure your device is secure, plus help you unlock and access your smartphone with just a tap of your finger. What is missing is Apple’s 3D Touch, which seems to have been abandoned for the iPhone SE. In terms of looks, the device does look almost exactly like the old iPhone 5s which perhaps speaks to Apple’s efforts and desire in their recycling devices. If you’re interested, the iPhone SE will go on sale on 31st March (with preorders beginning 24th March) with prices starting at USD399 (around RM1,611) for the 16GB model and USD499 (around RM2,015) for the 64GB model. In Singapore, the smartphone will go for SGD658 (around RM1,955) for the 16GB model and SGD828 for the 64GB model (around RM2,460)."

In what we suspect is perparation for the launch of the new Apple Watch 2, Apple has slashed RM300 off the top of their current Apple Watch Sport bringing it to an all-time low starting price of RM1,299. This means it’s more affordable to get an entry-level Apple Watch Sport than it is to purchase many of the other smartwatches running Android Wear or even Samsung’s Tizen. However, this price cut looks like it is only applicable for the Sport edition of the Apple Watch as the prices for the other variants remain the same. Nevertheless, that’s an incredible amount of savings, but that’s not all. Apple have also introduced a whole set of new straps including new colours for the Leather and Sport bands plus a space-black Milanese loop.

The Taiwanese company is in a tough spot and it looks like a lot of whether they will sink or swim is riding on their upcoming flagship device. We’ve seen some spec leaks and rumours in the past and now thanks to everyone’s favourite leakster we have even more information on the 10’s display — it’s LCD. In the past, rumours have pointed towards the HTC 10 featuring a 5.1-inch quad-HD panel mounted on the front and according to  , that panel will be Super LCD 5 instead of an AMOLED panel like the one on the One A9. Super LCD 5 is a variant of the LCD display that has no air gap between the outer glass and the actual display component. This is done to reduce glare and increase visibility. It is also supposed to be more frugal with power consumption. Speaking of power consumption, @evleaks has also revealed that the HTC 10 would have a large (for HTC’s standards) 3,000 mAh battery juicing up the device. Battery capacities upwards of 3,000 mAh is a rare sight on HTC devices, so this is definitely a welcomed addition if it proves true. On the inside, the 10 supposed to pack a powerful Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It’s also said to feature a front-facing fingerprint scanner and home button combo along with 2 capacitive buttons. Unfortunately, it looks like HTC have done away with one of their flagships biggest features — the BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers. A bummer, but at least it’s said to get a USB Type-C port with support for quick-charging. The HTC 10 has a lot to prove if it’s going to save HTC from the downward spiral that it’s caught in. Previous smartphone flagships have promised much but faltered in the delivery, especially when it came to optics. HTC are making similar promises with the 10, previously boasting “ ” cameras on both the front and back of the device. This time, the stakes are a little different though as the HTC 10 would actually have to make good on that promise if HTC wants to keep from sinking. That’s a tall order especially considering how stacked the smartphone camera market is right now. Could it possibly be better than the phenomenal  / ‘s 12-megapixel Dual Pixel shooter? I guess we’ll have to wait to find out. What do you guys think of the HTC 10?"

Its got a lot of the stuff that makes the iPad Pro tick under the hood and Apple is marketing it as the ultimate PC replacement. Apple is quite confident that the iPad Pro could be the “PC replacement device” that people are looking for, especially since there are 600 million PCs that are over 5 years old. They’re pretty sure that these users will just jump straight to the iPad Pro 9.7. Specs wise, the iPad Pro sports quite a bit of the same specs as its bigger counterpart; featuring the same A9X processor and four speakers. However, it does have an upgraded 12MP rear camera that can shoot 4K video alongside a 5MP front snapper with Retina Flash. The display has also gotten a significant bump up, as Apple claims that the new iPad Pro is 40% less reflective than the  ‘s screen and apparently that its got the lowest reflectivity while being the brightest tablet on the market. The iPad Pro’s screen also has some new tech called “True Tone Display” which adjusts the display’s colour temperature based on the ambient light plus its got blue-light reduction for all you late night users. The new iPad Pro will come in four different colours, space grey, silver, gold and rose gold, with preorders starting 24th March with the device officially hitting the market on 31st March. The iPad Pro 9.7″ is priced at US$599 (RM2418) for 32GB, US$749 (RM3024) for 128GB and US$899 (RM3629) for 256GB for the WiFi only models.

Or, to keep things simple, you can rent a portable wireless router from Travel Recommends with one of their packages and enjoy unlimited internet connectivity abroad. Travel Recommends has multiple packages covering several countries in Asia, Europe and even the States. From as low as RM15 a day, you can rent a wireless router unit from them for the duration of your trip. Compared to a roaming packing like the   plan, this “Internet rental” is considerably cheaper and covers many more countries. With the MaxisONE World, you would have to pay RM38/day for 500MB of high-speed internet and it will tap into your local quota once you’ve finished the 500MB. If you’ve finished both local and the allocated 500MB quota, your speeds will be throttled. But, the upside is you get unlimited calls and SMS. However, you would have to be a MaxisONE postpaid plan subscriber to take advantage of that plan.

Alexander Wong,Uber starts accepting cash payments in Johor Bahru,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/19/uber-cash-payments-johor-bahru-malaysia/,"Cash Payment,Johor Bahru,Uber,Uber Cash payment,Uber JB,Uber Malaysia,Uber Malaysia cash payment",Mobile Apps,2016-03-19,", the popular ride-sharing service on demand is testing out cash payments in Johor Bahru. Before this, Uber was running as a cashless service with your rides charged automatically thru credit or debit card. Is this a good move? The beauty of Uber is the ease of getting on and off a ride. There’s no need to worry about small change so you can get from point A to B hassle free.  Prior to this, Uber has started   at selected markets where card payments have limited reach. According to them, there are many potential customers that couldn’t experience Uber as they lack any form of electronic payment. To make clean and safe rides more accessible, they are experimenting cash as an option. This is similar to  , which initially accepts only cash and eventually they have started accept card payments.  Johor Bahru is picked as the first city to roll out cash payments for Uber rides in Malaysia. If this is successful, they could introduce this to other cities in the country. Personally, I feel that automated card payments are the way to go. Not only it provides a seamless experience, but it is also more time efficient as the drivers would not need to make longer stops to look for change.  Furthermore, you won’t want to get into the same taxi experience where the driver runs out of change for your freshly ATM-withdrawn RM100 note. For drivers, this could also pose a risk for carrying more cash at hand and possibly being caught by SPAD or taxi drivers. In terms of electronic payment accessibility, most ATM cards issued by local banks are already debit cards carrying either Mastercard or VISA. The new payment feature is rolling out in stages and customers in JB should be getting the cash option gradually in the coming weeks. To pay by cash, make sure CASH is selected before you request for a ride. When the trip ends, just pay for the amount that’s displayed in the app. Is accepting cash a good move or would you prefer Uber to stay as a cashless system?

It’s been a long wait, but no doubt Windows fans will rejoice. Software updates are great, but looking at the downward spiral that Windows Phone is heading into, one really has to wonder if it’s too little too late. Following the announcement of the rollout, Microsoft released a list of supported devices, and while there are more than initially expected, it’s still a fairly limited affair — for instance, my   isn’t on the list. Here are a   of devices that can be upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile 10586.164: According to their blog post, Microsoft stated that only these devices were chosen because Windows 10 delivers “significant new innovations” that if applied to older devices might “impact customer experience”. They then continued to say that with this crop of devices, they are confident that they can continue to deliver a good customer experience. Well, good customer experience or not, that remains to be seen, but from what we could tell based on our  , it’s a tough promise to make. Updates are usually fun and if you find your device on that list, you can download the   app from the Windows Store to check if Windows 10 Mobile is available for your device (if you haven’t already received it OTA). Keep in mind that even if your device is on the list, you may not get this update today as there are other variances to account for. Stuff like your region, mobile operator or service provider among other things may factor into a delay on the update. Windows Phone as a platform has faced many problems. Poised to be an OS that should have shaken up the Android-iOS hegemony, it simply tripped over itself before it could even stand with the big boys. Recent news seems to make matters even worse for Microsoft’s operating system as one of the key selling points of the platform, their maps and navigation service HERE Maps, is   for the Windows platform. That’s like if Google Maps left the Android platform. What’s more HERE aren’t the only people stopping support for Windows Phone, even WhatsApp are   their supported devices by killing off support for Windows Phone 7.1. Things aren’t looking that good and we can’t honestly say that  ."

The folks on the east side are really getting spoilt for choice now.  Simply called as the New Digi Postpaid 68 promo, this RM68/month postpaid is exclusive to East Malaysian customers for a limited time only. It also packs 5GB of data like the MaxisONE Plan as well as unlimited calls to all networks. SMS is unlimited but it is only for 3 of your favourite contacts. On top of that, you also get internet rollover to carry forward unused internet to the following month. As an added bonus, there’s also 1 year free iflix subscription worth RM96 plus Capture Cloud storage of 30GB.  As a comparison, Digi’s current   offers 6GB of internet with 150 minutes of calls and SMS. Alternatively, you can go for their unlimited calls and text option but it comes with 3GB of data.

Rory Lee,OPPO R9 and R9 Plus — the real selfie expert,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/18/oppo-r9-and-r9-plus-the-real-selfie-expert/,"Android,Malaysia,Oppo,OPPO R9,OPPO R9 Malaysia,OPPO R9 official,OPPO R9 Plus,OPPO R9 Plus Malaysia,OPPO R9 Plus official,oppo smartphone,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2016-03-18,"By now I’m sure many of you have heard this incredibly catchy (and sometimes annoying)   from OPPO. As often as it gets stuck in your head, it does highlight one important thing — we’re taking more selfies today than we ever have in the past. If you’re a smartphone maker, you’d definitely want to cash in on this — many are — and while OPPO’s recent attempt at a “selfie expert” fell  , their new duo looks much more promising. Kicking things off, the newly announced   and   have front facing cameras that are designed to give you 16 megapixels of selfie goodness. In sheer megapixel count alone, they’re double nearly every other smartphone selfie camera out there. But we all know megapixels aren’t everything and thankfully the R9 duo also packs a fast f/2.0 lens to allow as much light as possible to hit that sensor. They’ve also got OPPO’s improved beautification plus selfie panorama modes which should go down well with selfie enthusiasts. Beyond that, the R9 is a pretty standard midrange device. It’s got all the usual suspects in a mid-level OPPO device with a 5.5-inch full HD AMOLED panel sitting on top of a 2GHz MediaTek Helio P10 processor mated to 4GB of RAM. Keeping everything running is a 2,850 mAh battery. Since it’s a camera-centric device, it does pack more internal storage as users can get 64GB of expandable internal storage (via microSD up to 128GB). But it becomes pretty obvious which camera you’re supposed to be using when the “primary” rear-facing shooter is only a 13MP sensor with PDAF and an f/2.2 5-element lens. With the name being the biggest hint, the R9 Plus has a larger 6-inch full HD AMOLED panel on the front. Despite the larger screen, the device does have slightly wider bezels (1.76mm versus the R9’s 1.66mm) but it still has a better screen-to-body ratio of 79.3% (versus the R9’s 77.7%). Inside, OPPO has also upped the specifications to a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB (128GB version to follow) of expandable internal storage. The primary camera unit does make a little more sense here as the R9 Plus packs a 16MP Sony IMX298 sensor with PDAF and an f/2.0 lens. It has a larger 4,120 mAh battery which should give it pretty decent battery life. Design wise, the devices have a pretty sexy look with the near bezel-less screen and thin profile accentuated by nice round edges for better grip. OPPO have also abandoned the rear-facing fingerprint scanner, choosing instead to mount it on the front of the device below the display. While that does make it easier to unlock when it’s on the table, I’m still more of a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor kind of guy. The most unfortunate thing is that the Chinese company’s super-fast Super VOOC flash charge doesn’t make an appearance on the R9 duo. You’ll just have to “settle” for regular VOOC (70% charge in 30 mins), I guess. They do come in two colours though — gold and rose gold. Another bummer is that both smartphones come with colorOS 3.0 that is still built on top of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop (Android N previews are out, OPPO, c’mon) but we certainly hope it gets updated when it leaves China. Unfortunately, there is no information on global availability, but it will hit shelves in China on 12 April with the regular R9 being priced at CNY2,799 (around RM1,755) while the bigger R9 Plus will cost CNY3,299 (around RM2,068). According to OPPO Malaysia, it will be   on our shores sometime next month."

One of the world’s most valuable companies, the pioneer of the smartphone as we know and love today, as well as a company who dares to try some truly interesting things with their devices (removing the CD drive on computers, and potentially the   on the next iPhone). Now, I’ve been called many things in the past, “Apple basher” being one of them, and much of that is because I don’t agree with many of the things the Cupertino company does. But, there has always been one thing I like that Apple gets so right — their ads. Debuting their latest piece showcasing the “Hey Siri” hands-free functionality on the iPhone 6s, Apple enlisted the help of Sesame Street’s favourite cookie-loving monster. It probably isn’t the best representation of Siri’s accuracy considering how it often struggles with strong accents (no offence Cookie, but you’ve got a pretty strong accent too), but it does leave you with a warm feeling and a smile on your face. I don’t know about you, but it’s ads that evoke this feeling that I remember best. Now I’m not one to buy something because I saw what it could do in an ad, but I know there are many who do that. Ads are really powerful and more and more companies are realising that the best ads aren’t really ads at all — they represent something special or human. Apple does this by adding a touch of humour and wit. It’s subtle and smart, and that makes all the difference. It humanises the ad. Nobody gets it right the first time, not even Apple. Just look at their old ads for the older iPhones. What they mostly did was boast about the features and it wasn’t until the iPhone 6/6 Plus commercial about Health that I started to see them get it right. They’ve almost perfected this aspect of ad-making and it’s truly awesome to see. It’s almost magical how Apple can take some of the most mundane and gimmicky smartphone features, build an ad around them, and make the audience feel like they   have it on their smartphone right now. I can tell you that the next iPhone will have killer specifications and some kick-ass features, but in all honesty, the thing I’m looking forward to the most are its ads. Not the launch one because that will probably be pompous if the   is going to be a trend, but the ones that come after. The ones like this 3D Touch ad that I absolutely love."

Rory Lee,Battle of the edges — S6 edge vs S7 edge vs S6 edge+,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/17/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-vs-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-vs-galaxy-s7-edge-malaysia-comparison/,,,2016-03-17,"Dual-edge displays are a magnificent thing to behold. They look utterly unique and gives everyday smartphone tasks a little pizzaz. It’s hard to put into words what the experience is like, it’s really something you should see for yourself. Sure, you could head to a   store to play with one of the demo units, but from my experience, you fully appreciate the experience only once you start using it as your daily driver. If you’re keen, the only thing left to ask is: Which edge do you get? To date, Samsung has churned out four edge devices — the single edge  , the  , the   and the  . While the Note Edge did get the ball rolling, it didn’t have a dual-edge display and its edge functionality is slightly different from the dual-edge displays we know of today. It’s more of a one-of-a-kind smartphone. If we’re looking at dual-edge smartphones. the choice would then fall to the remaining three — the S6 edge, S6 edge+ and S7 edge — all of which are enticing choices. Logic would dictate that the latest S7 edge is the easy choice, being the latest and most powerful of the trio, but, people might take issue with the 5.5-inch panel on the S7 edge. They might, for instance, prefer the larger 5.7-inch S6 edge+ or even the smaller 5.1-inch S6 edge. But what are the trade-offs? On paper, the S7 edge definitely wins out here as it sports Samsung’s newest top-of-the-line octa-core chip in the Exynos 8890. Paired with 4GB of RAM and Android 6.0 Marshmallow and this device will zip through and remain snappy regardless of what you’re doing with the device. However, it’s not to say the other two are sluggish — Samsung’s 2015 flagships still pack a punch. Throughout our usage of both the S6 edge and S6 edge+, we didn’t encounter any problems with lag or stuttering going through daily tasks. It’s still a powerful device by today’s standards and will likely keep going strong for quite some time. Likely the biggest difference you’d notice is the heat under stress. The S6 edge and S6 edge+ gets noticeably hotter than the S7 edge though not to the extent where it gets uncomfortable. Here’s where the S7 edge nudges ahead of the other two devices too. It’s simply got a better camera, despite the drop in megapixels, as that 12MP Dual Pixel camera is one of the best smartphone snappers in the market right now."

While the other internals like the RAM and storage remains the same, these two chips are quite different. The question then became: is one faster than the other? Well, according to this speed test video, the Exynos 8890 (White) unit is just a touch faster than the Snapdragon 820 (Gold) variant. It launches apps and returns to the home screen just a little bit faster than the SD820 unit, but not so much that it might be terribly noticeable in real world usage. For benchmarks, the Exynos 8890 unit also performs slightly better in the overall score. However, the breakdown does reveal that it falls behind quite significantly in terms of 3D GPU performance. This falls somewhat in line with a test ran earlier by   where they pitted both devices against each other in a series of benchmarks. In PhoneArena’s test, the Snapdragon variant scored a higher average in both the overall AnTuTu benchmark as well as in the GPU-specific tests. However, the Exynos chip edged it out when it came to browsing benchmarks. It is worth noting that they ran the test on a Galaxy S7, not an S7 edge, but the end result should be fairly representative of the larger edge model as well. You can view their findings in the table below: From their tests, they concluded that the performance difference is nearly negligible as they are very comparable systems. Comparable in performance, perhaps, but what about things like battery life? Our   (Galaxy S7 edge) on moderate usage pulled out a measly 3 hours and 40 minutes of screen-on time, giving us about 17 and a half hours of time on battery. It’s a pretty big difference if you compare it to   (Snapdragon 820) which gave him close to 6 hours of screen-on time with a day and a half on battery with moderate usage. Of course, that could be down to a number of reasons as well as what he deems moderate usage, but it beggars belief that he could pull out nearly double the SOT on similar usage.

Although you gain freedom in usage without having to worry about running out of credits, there is a chance that when your bill arrives at the end of the month, you will be paying more than you’d expect. In the past, one of the biggest worries when switching to a postpaid plan was bill shock — the possibility of paying for something you thought you’d never use. Some horror stories have users rack up thousands of ringgit because of accidental data usage and roaming on the wrong network. To combat that,   implemented a Pay-Per-Use format where it charged users who were using data on their smartphone without a data plan. This format charged users RM10 for every block of 50MB data that they would use up to a cap of RM50/month which works out to 250MB/month. After 250MB, users could continue surfing without any extra charge but at a throttled speed. However, on 14 January 2016, they quietly revised their Pay-Per-Use conditions to increase it to 10 blocks, meaning charges now cap at RM100/month — double the previous threshold. Maxis says that this is to improve user browsing experience, and that’s true to a certain extent since users get to use up to 500MB of unrestricted speeds, but that also means users would have to pay more per month if their usage exceeds 250MB. If you’d like to find out more about this, you can head on over to their  , or view your Pay-Per-Use stats via the MyMaxis App ( / ). That said, it is a little silly to use your smartphone data these days without subscribing to an actual data plan. That means this Pay-Per-Use plan acts more like a safety net for those without a plan who accidentally turn on their data than someone who actually wants to surf. Since this is the case, I’d think that a lower cap would benefit users more since they would ultimately be paying less. What do you guys think?"

For storage, the device comes with 32GB of internal storage but you have the option to expand that via a microSD card slot that occupies the second SIM slot on the hybrid dual SIM tray.

Mounted nearly flush to the back of the smartphone’s glass back is Samsung’s brand new 12-megapixel Dual Pixel camera with the same fast f/1.7 aperture lens that is easily one of the best smartphone cameras right now. With the new Dual Pixel technology and the fast lens, the Galaxy S7 edge promises up to 95% brighter photos as well as an uber fast focusing speed. Inside, a 3,600 mAh battery gives the device juice allowing you to make full use of the Galaxy S7 edge’s new gaming enhanced features in the Game Launcher and Game Tools options.

Rory Lee,Sony’s Concept N headphones are the Google Glass for your ears,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/14/sonys-concept-n-headphones-are-the-google-glass-for-your-ears/,"Concept N,open ear earphones,Sony,Sony Concept N,Sony Concept N earphones,Sony earphones,Sony headphones,Sony Xperia Ear,SXSW,Xperia Ear","Mobile Accessories,Sony",2016-03-14,"Sony’s   at the   in Barcelona represented a shift in focus when it came to the development of mobile devices, bringing out several concepts that go beyond simply augmenting a smartphone. At SXSW (South by Southwest) they pulled back the covers of yet another futuristic device that falls in line with the experience Sony are promoting with their hands-free   device — the Concept N headphones. Concept N is the child of Sony’s R&D arm Future Lab initiative — an arm tasked with showing off early prototypes of products and gathering feedback. On the surface, the N doesn’t look all too different or radical when compared to existing headphones from other manufacturers, but it does have a trick or two up its sleeve. The first thing you’ll notice is that they’re not connected to your ear and are designed to be worn around your neck. So how do you listen to music then? The N has a set of cleverly placed speakers designed to play music to your ears in a limited range around your head so you can also listen to your surroundings and have a proper conversation. We suspect that this wouldn’t be too great for sound quality if you’re mixing in a noisy background, but the folks at The Verge and Engadget seem pretty impressed with it. If you want a more quiet experience, though, Sony has a pair of “open-ear earphones” that go along with the N, letting you clip them on your ear for what we suspect would be a more private listening experience. Since these V-shaped earphones are open-ear though, you can still listen to your surroundings while your favourite track is on. The drivers are mounted at one end of the V, feeding audio to the other end of the V that goes in your ear, resulting in a slick minimalist design. That’s not all, Sony’s Concept N has a bunch of, although very limited, augmented-reality-esque features too — though not in the generic visual AR sense. Instead, the N responds to voice commands and can tell you useful stuff like the weather, local news updates and local restaurant information all with a simple trigger phrase “Listen up Arc!” before your command. What’s most impressive is that you can tell it to take a photo too. Once the command is inputted (or shouted, depending on how loud your surroundings are), the otherwise hidden camera mounted on the right edge of the neckband opens up and takes a photo before disappearing again. It eliminates one of the Google Glass’ biggest flaws when it comes to a wearable camera — people don’t feel like you’re always taking a photo/video of them. It’s an interesting device in the way it functions and brings aural AR into our lives giving me a very distinct   vibe. Sony has always been one of the great pioneers of audio technology and it’s great to see them pull out something seriously cool. What do you think of the Concept N? Let us know in the comments below."

It is also mated with 4GB of RAM and there’s a choice of either 64GB or 128GB of storage. With a larger battery, the R9 Plus is thicker at 7.7mm and it weighs 185grams.  In the imaging department, both R9 and R9 Plus will sport a 16MP front camera for higher resolution selfies. For the rear, the R9 gets a 13MP camera while the R9 Plus gets a 16MP unit. Yup, the R9 has a higher pixelcount camera at the front than its main camera.  Both models are listed to be running on ColorOS 3.0 and we hope that it comes with at least Android 6.0 Marshmallow underneath. According to OPPO Malaysia, the new   will be available a month later, which is sometime in mid-April. Colour wise, expect the R9 to come in Gold and Rose Gold.  As mentioned previously, OPPO has yet to release a proper flagship device since the Find 7. While   the “Find 9″ that we’re looking for, the Snapdragon 652 processor with 4GB of RAM should put this on par against other high-end phablet contenders."

According to the rumour mill, the upcoming mini flagship is said to pack either a Snapdragon 820 or an Exynos 8890 processor, and 3GB of RAM on the inside. There is currently no information on the internal storage but judging by the processor and RAM alone, the device is looking like a worthy challenger. The only drawback, it seems, would be the 1280×720 pixel display said to adorn the front of the smartphone. But, since it’s less than 5 inches, the pixel density should still be relatively high. What’s more, the S7 mini is said to sport a 12-megapixel primary camera packed into a smartphone package that is only 9.9mm thin. Based on the megapixel count, it looks like it could be the same Dual Pixel sensor found on the regular   and   that we  . It’s not entirely surprising if Samsung does come up with a mini variant as they’ve done so in the past. One of the biggest problems with old the Galaxy S mini variants was that they always came with watered down specs. That’s kind of a bummer especially since they bore the Galaxy S flagship badge. The one company that really gets the “compact” or “mini” flagship variants right has been Sony, who packed the same flagship components into a smaller form factor. If these rumours prove true, that could mean Samsung are finally picking up on this trend. But, this also means it becomes a direct competitor for Sony’s   too. But, we don’t think that’s too fair of a comparison if we’re going off these rumoured specs as the S7 mini simply blows the Xperia Z5 Compact out of the water. The real battle royale would be with the iPhone and with the S7 mini’s price likely to be lower, this could prove to be an interesting fight. This is of course if these rumours prove true, which we can’t know for certain right now, so do take what we say here with a grain of salt."

If you think about it, it is like having a bunch of guys boasting about their own manhood. Everyone claims to have the longest but nobody can actually verify it.  According to OpenSignal’s latest data updated on 11 March 2016, Digi currently has the widest coverage in Malaysia. So looks like it’s a win for team yellow as it claims to currently cover   with 4G LTE.  But is this really true? When you view the  , you should see a map which plots the coverage areas of the telcos around you. To get a nationwide sample, you can key in Malaysia from the search bar.

 You probably thought Celcom would have the widest 2G network in the country but it isn’t, according to OpenSignal. When we toggle the map to 2G only, U Mobile suddenly ranks #1 while Maxis takes last position at #4. The funny thing is that U Mobile doesn’t even own a 2G network. For areas that are out of U Mobile’s coverage, it relies on Maxis 2G and 3G networks as part of their RAN sharing agreement.  
 For 4G only, Digi is ranked first, followed by Celcom then U Mobile and Maxis. U Mobile which doesn’t even cover East Malaysia is ranked higher than Maxis for coverage. Very odd indeed.  So what does this tell us? Looking at the above, it seems that OpenSignal may not be entirely accurate for Malaysia at the time being. It collects mobile quality data from their OpenSignal app that’s available for   and  . Even OpenSignal themselves urge you to install the app in order to improve the maps. Think about how many Malaysians have installed the app? Most of you would have use Speedtest.net instead. When OpenSignal published its   report, it was derived from a sample size of 325,221 users. Out of those numbers, we won’t know how many of them are from Malaysia.  Having crowd source data is good but the report is only going to be as good as the sample size itself. So if you want to contribute to better stats on network quality, perhaps it is time to give OpenSignal a try. This could work if OpenSignal becomes as popular as crowdsourcing GPS app Waze in Malaysia.

While the actual launch date is still up in the air, here’s a clearer leak of the HTC 10.  As seen on the earlier renders, the front gets a  -like design that has a fingerprint scanner underneath the screen. Interestingly there are capacitive buttons for Back and Recent app accompanying the home button, which we think is a good move. The current HTC smartphones including the HTC One A9 and One M9+ use purely on-screen buttons along with its fingerprint scanner. Of course, some would definitely point out that this is starting to look a lot like a Samsung Galaxy smartphone.  Surrounding the device is a metal frame that’s visible from the front, which is somewhat similar to the Nexus 6P. The back of the device is where the HTC 10 stands out. It gets a curve back with a polished chamfered edge. If we take a look at the camera module, it seems to protrude a bit, while next to it appears to be a dual-tone LED flash and possibly a laser AutoFocus light. According to @evleaks, the HTC 10 will come in 4 colour options – namely carbon gray, glacier silver (with either black or white coloured front) and topaz gold.  There’s still no mention of an official launch but it could be after the Galaxy S7 fever starts to fizzle out. Huawei will be   its P9 flagship next month on 6 April."

Flagship smartphones and their cameras have come a long way from the feature phones of old. In the present, they’re also just as likely to replace your point and shoot camera in most cases.

Rory Lee,Unboxing the “perfect” smartphone — the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/11/samsung-galaxy-s7-malaysia-unboxing/,"2016 flagship,Android,first impressions,Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Malaysia,smartphone,Unboxing","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-03-11,"‘s greatest flagship device ever — the   — was a long-awaited affair. When we first saw it at MWC 2016, we couldn’t wait to get our hands on the device. Well, after a long (it wasn’t that long, but it felt long) wait, it finally came…and I pounced on it. The unboxing experience was reasonable. Samsung was never one to have elaborate unboxing experiences for their flagships, often defaulting to a generic small box you could fit in a clutch. This one was a little different, though. In terms of dimensions, the box is pretty much the same size as last year’s flagship boxes but this time instead of pulling the lid off, you unwrapped the lip of the box and watch as it rolls out to reveal the phone tucked neatly in its tray. Underneath is business as usual where you have a box with the SIM tool and the relevant paperwork separating the phone tray and the accessories that come with it. Speaking of the accessories, the Galaxy S7 doesn’t come with a whole lot of kit compared to something like the Huawei Mate 8. It’s got a pair of in-ear headphones set in a tinted box, a charging cable, a power brick and a USB OTG adapter. The power brick is Samsung’s Adaptive Fast Charging brick that supports two voltages with different amps — either 9V, 1.67A or 5V, 2.0A. Setting up the device was the usual affair but the included USB OTG adapter does let you access a nifty Samsung feature: Smart Switch. Or at least it should, but for some reason, the Galaxy S7 edge didn’t recognise the HTC One A9 I was copying information over from. Instead, it repeatedly reminded me that the connected smartphone needed to be “Android 4.3 and above” which is weird because the One A9 is already on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. If you’re unfamiliar with Smart Switch, it’s basically an application that lets you copy your files — apps, contacts, data, etc — over from your existing device to your new Galaxy smartphone, or in this case, the Galaxy S7 edge. Despite the fact that we couldn’t transfer the files via cable, Smart Switch supports wireless transfer as well. Odd. Simply install the app on your old device (for a list of compatible platforms head on over  ) and choose the stuff you want to transfer, then hit send. It will take awhile depending on how much information you want to transfer. Though it did take only about 10 minutes to copy files over wirelessly, we reckon a wired transfer should be faster. My first impressions of the device? It feels awesome for a glass-backed device. The rounded back really helps with grip and somehow Samsung has made the glass and metal seam even more flush than before. The camera feels excellent and focuses almost as quickly as my eye can, plus the overall performance of the device is just really, really snappy. Is it the perfect smartphone? I guess you’ll have to wait for our full review to find out. If you’d like to see more unboxing and device photos, be sure to check out our   on Facebook."

If you’re looking for a tablet to consume your iflix and Netflix shows, this could be your cup of tea. Like the name suggests, this is a 10″ tablet (10.1″ to be exact) with a wide 16:10 display aspect ratio. The screen does 1920×1200 resolution which gives a pixel density of 224 PPI (pixels per inch). The design is nothing to shout about but it gets a metal back like most of its unibody smartphones.  At the front of the M2 10.0, there’s a fingerprint scanner that unlocks on a single tap. While it looks like a Samsung tablet, there are no capacitive keys on either side, as it uses on-screen buttons. You can, however, access the back and recent apps from the fingerprint scanner by swiping either to the left or right which isn’t as intuitive. The fingerprint unlock is super quick but setting it up require more fingerprint taps than usual.  As an “M-series” tablet, this is a multimedia-centric device. Unlike the smaller M2 8.0, this doesn’t have two but a total of four speakers (2 treble + 2 bass) enhanced by harman kardon. The speaker grills are located at the top and bottom, and the audio is output is actually quite impressive for video and music playback. On the inside, the MediaPad M2 10.0 runs on a Kirin 930 processor with either 2GB or 3GB RAM. It also comes with a choice of either 16GB or 64GB of storage but you can still expand it further with microSD. WiFi and 4G LTE variants are also available too depending on spec levels.  For those who wish to sketch, the tablet is also available with a stylus that’s called the M-Pen. It boasts 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity which is the same as the Galaxy Note5 S Pen and double of a Surface Pen with the latest Surface Pro 4. The M-Pen is like a typical ball-point clip pen and it feels just right.  There are two buttons on the side – one for selection and another for eraser. At the other end of the M-Pen is a metal clip which helps to secure itself in a shirt pocket.  In case you need to take a picture with it, it gets a 13MP f/2.0 main camera that comes with a flash light. For selfies and skype videos, it gets a 5MP front shooter. The MediaPad M2 comes with a 6,660mAh battery and it still maintains a respectable 7.35mm thickness while weighing about half a kilogram.

With the current generation of touch-enabled and wireless devices, many teenagers wouldn’t know how it’s like to go online back in the days.

Our current smartphones today have better specs than that. Unlike the current PCs with Windows 8 or Windows 10, starting up a computer back then can really take a long time. Before there was fibre or ADSL, most people rely on the good old dial-up modem.

Based on the renders, the device does indeed look identical to that of the iPhone 5S with almost no traces of the rounded front display that was suggested. This is, of course, due to a few reasons. The first is that these are merely renders, not official images so the final product could turn out to be slightly different.

Despite its higher price tag, this is still the most affordable Snapdragon 820 powered smartphone you can buy right now and it’s cheaper than most 2015 flagships.

Remember the  ? That came with dual-camera set up that provides extra bokeh effects and the ability to shoot higher-resolution photos by combining images taken from both cameras. Other brands that have tried dual-cameras include HTC and most recently LG with its new G5. Apart from making high-end devices, Huawei wants to reinvent smartphone photography by   with Leica. That’s quite a bold move considering established players like Samsung and Microsoft’s Lumia (with its PureView) have raised the bar tremendously.  So what can we expect? Like the P8, there will be   including a standard, Lite and perhaps a Max version. Under the hood, Huawei should be using their in-house developed Kirin 950 processor that offers a balance of both performance and frugal battery life. Looking at how   the Mate 8 is, you can expect the P9 to undercut other mainstream brands. We’ll find out for sure a month from now."

To find out what makes it tick on the inside, ifixit has teardown a unit for your viewing pleasure.  While physically it looks similar to the previous version, the new Galaxy S7 is actually harder to repair with a repairability score of just 3/10. As comparison, the Galaxy S6   4/10, while the S6 edge   just 3/10.  The Galaxy S7 like its former model use glass for front and back. There are no screws so you’ll need to remove the back panel that’s secured with glue. The internals are easily replaceable with its modular components including the battery, cameras and the headphone jack. With Galaxy S7 having IP68 water resistance, it has rubber linings to keep water out from its internals.   For longer gameplay without overheating, they have also taken a closer look at the S7’s liquid cooling. The thin copper strip is less than a milimetre thick and weighs less than half a gram. In another video, cutting this copper strip reveals   inside, but it does dissipate heat to its outer frame.  Overall, ifixit found the S7 to be a tougher device to fix. Despite its modular components, the display needs to be removed if you need to replace the microUSB port. Since it uses glass for both sides, it is more prone to cracks if you were to drop the device. Another challenge is that it’s almost impossible to replace the front glass without destroying the actual display.  While the device looks good, we suggest that you invest in a case or take up a device protection program that covers damages and theft. Since we are getting only the   in Malaysia, we can only assume that it could be harder to repair than this."

And sure, there is a variety of second or part-time jobs out there to help you attain them easily, but let’s face it! Having a second or part-time job requires a certain type of dedication and commitment that perhaps not many are in the position to do so for various reasons such as inflexibility of the current or part-time jobs.   But this is where Grab plays a role.  Not just poised to providing a safer and alternative option of transport, GrabCar, which is available on the Grab App (formerly known as MyTeksi), offers a flexible and viable option for those who want to earn some serious money without minimal time commitment, something which other ride-sharing app platforms just cannot provide. So how does it work, you may ask…Pretty easy actually.  
 With the updated Grab incentive, the focus is not on the hours behind the wheel, but on how many jobs are completed. For example, on normal weekdays (Mon – Thurs) you only need to accept one job while on the way to work and two after. With the minimum fare of RM7 per job, you will already hit tier 4 target and receive a bonus incentive which rounds each job to RM16, making your daily earnings RM48.  Next, on weekends (Fri – Sun), you accept five to six jobs a day with the same minimum fare of RM7 and with each job rounded up to RM16, your daily earning is between RM90 to RM96.  
 Yes, we are aware you have limited spare time but with just 14 hours a week (that’s as low as 2 hours a day!) you can take home a minimum of RM1,792 guaranteed gross income per month.* But what can you possibly do with RM1,792?

The Oculus exec stressed that even the most pimped out Mac out there can’t keep up with the Rift’s VR hardware, making it not as enjoyable as pairing it with a PC. He added that “It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn’t prioritise high-end GPUs” and even if “You can buy a US$ 6,000 Mac Pro with the top-of-the-line AMD FirePro D700, (and) it still doesn’t match our recommended specs”. However, Luckey did mention that if Apple ever decided to change how it picks out internals, Oculus would be happy to support Mac systems in the future. Currently, we don’t buy PCs or laptops because they can handle virtual reality systems – it isn’t vastly adoptable yet but one day you can bet that almost every person will have a VR headset. For gaming and learning, virtual reality takes our senses to places that previously were never possible. An easy fix for Mac users would be having dual-boot software installed and probably upping that AMD card to a Nvidia graphics card. On the other end,   are some ready built PCs that’ll be ready to handle any VR task. Question is, are we ready for VR? On a side note, you’ve gotta love moments like these, rest in peace Steve."
Rory Lee,There is no liquid in the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge’s “liquid-cooling” system,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/04/there-is-no-liquid-in-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-edges-liquid-cooling-system/,"Galaxy S7 edge liquid cooling,Galaxy S7 edge watercooling,Galaxy S7 liquid cooling,Galaxy S7 watercooling,liquid cooled,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung watercooling,water cooled smartphone","Android,Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Others,Samsung",2016-03-04,"is many things — a well built, well engineered, well spec-ed smartphone — but apparently the one thing it isn’t, is a liquid-cooled device. Well, not in the conventional sense. YouTube teardown specialist  , in his dismantling of the Galaxy S7 edge smartphone, found out that there is no visible liquid within the heat pipe. There was, however, a copper wire mesh on the inside acting as a heat sink to draw away heat from the processor. Why is there no liquid? Unlike the heat pipe used in the Galaxy S7 phones, traditional liquid cooling involves a pump that keeps tubes full of liquid flowing, allowing the coolant to bring the heat from a CPU or GPU to a radiator/heatsink to be dissipated by a fan. In contrast, heat pipes use an evaporative cooling technique which transfers thermal energy from one point to another by the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid or coolant. So, whatever or however little fluid there was in the pipe, if there even was any to begin with, becomes vapour as soon as it heats up and would likely be released when the pipe was sliced open. Heat pipes can also be found in most traditional PC heatsinks or coolers, but we don’t exactly call those “liquid-cooling” solutions. We can see how this vapour heat pipe would be more practical in a smartphone, but can we really say that it is liquid-cooled? Samsung aren’t the only ones to employ this form of “liquid cooling” as the same system is currently employed in Microsoft’s Lumia flagships as well. One notable exception when it comes to liquid-cooled smartphones, as JerryRigEverything points out, is the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. When they tore that device apart, there was visible liquid within the heat pipes. To be fair, in their presentation during Unpacked 2016, Samsung did explain their cooling system pretty well — how it had some liquid that vapourises when hot and condenses when cooled — staying away from the actual usage of “water-cooled smartphone”. In fact, I couldn’t find any mention of “water-cooling” on their product page either. Perhaps then, the term water-cooling was coined more by the media and/or misinformed product guys than anyone else. What do you guys think of this “water-cooled” smartphone? Let us know in the comments below."
Rory Lee,OPPO’s R9 smartphones pass certification — definitely not flagships,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/04/oppos-r9-smartphones-pass-certification-definitely-not-flagships/,"Oppo,OPPO R9,OPPO R9 Plus,OPPO TENAA,rumour mill,smartphone,tenaa","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo,Rumour Mill",2016-03-04,"Speculation has been making its rounds on the upcoming   smartphone, many of which suggest that it could be OPPO’s   device of the year especially considering the absence of the Find 9. Further “leaked” specifications hinted towards a flagship device too, but thanks to Chinese certification agency TENAA, we now know for certain one fact is true — the R9 is not the flagship you’re looking for. Two devices passed through TENAA — the R9 and R9 Plus — revealing their internal specifications as well as the smartphone’s overall design. There was no Snapdragon 820 SoC, no Quad HD display, which means it’s no 2016 flagship. Instead, for the smaller R9, we get a 5.5-inch full HD 1080p AMOLED panel on the front. Inside, it’s powered by a 1.95GHz octa-core processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage. Keeping everything running is a 2,850 mAh battery. Although the processor’s model name isn’t mentioned, it’s fairly obvious that this isn’t a quad-core Snapdragon 820 chip as the SoC in the R9 is an octa-core unit. Moving on to the larger R9 Plus we find a larger 6-inch 1080p full HD AMOLED panel on the front, with a 1.8GHz octa-core processor thrumming away inside. Paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage and a large 4,120 mAh battery, the R9 Plus is definitely the one with a better spec sheet — still no Snapdragon 820 in sight. Teased as a camera-centric phone, the R9 duo definitely packs the specifications to back that up as they feature two 16-megapixel cameras — one on the front and one on the back — with an LED flash. Besides that, both smartphones feature support for dual SIM 4G LTE connectivity and a rounded metal body. That’s not all, the smartphones will be sporting a front-mounted fingerprint sensor tucked under an oval home button. We can’t tell from the pictures if it is a physical button, but there is a coloured chrome frame around the button which suggests that it could. This would be the first time OPPO has mounted a fingerprint sensor on the front. Both smartphones will also come running Android Lollipop out-of-the-box. If you tuned in to our   coverage, you would have picked up on OPPO’s blazingly fast Super VOOC charging technology where they   a smartphone in 15 minutes. Now that is an awesome technological development, but unfortunately, it doesn’t look like it will be making its way into the R9. According to a recent   on Gizchina, OPPO advertised that the R9 will give you 2 hours of talk time from a 5-minute charge. That’s the   OPPO made for their R7 series of smartphones and those only use regular VOOC. SuperVOOC claims to give you 10 whopping hours of talk time after the same amount of time spent on the plug. That said, the camera-centric R9 series could potentially feature OPPO’s new   camera technology. Well, we will all find out soon enough as the launch date has been set for  ."

These high end devices don’t come cheap and for bargain hunters, you probably need to compromise on some features if you don’t have a huge budget. What if there’s a way to get a smartphone with “flagship” class features without burning a hole in your pocket? That’s where the   comes in and it does look the part too. It has a metal body, a fairly large screen with great resolution and a fingerprint scanner works brilliantly well. Here are 5 reasons why the honor 5X should be your top pick under RM1,000. An affordable phone doesn’t have to feel cheap. With the honor 5X, it gets a premium look and feel with its unibody metal body. It isn’t just any metal slab as it gets a diamond polished aluminium back with a brushed look. While this is a mid-range device, it does look like a more expensive smartphone.  With the worldwide web and social timeline in your hands, the honor 5X has a large 5.5” display with Full HD resolution. The screen size is similar to the iPhone 6s Plus but it is more compact to hold with thinner bezels and reduced height. With an IPS panel, you get great colour reproduction and viewing angles under a fully laminated screen.  Get security that’s convenient to set up and use. Like the honor 7, the honor 5X comes with a rear mounted fingerprint scanner that’s easy to set up with just 6 taps. Unlocking the phone from your pocket is done instantly in just 0.5 seconds. It just unlocks with a gentle tap on the sensor. The fingerprint sensor also lets you do more such as taking photos including selfies, swiping down to view notification and view all running apps by swiping up.  Micro-SIM, Nano-SIM or MicroSD card, the honor 5X fits them all. With a dedicated slot for MicroSD, there’s no compromise if you’re currently a dual-SIM user. Whether you’re using Micro or Nano SIM sizes, both slots support 4G LTE which can be managed from the phone settings.  The honor 5X gets a 13MP f/2.0 main camera while selfies are taken with a 5MP f/2.4 shooter camera that has a large 1.4 micron pixel size and a 22mm wide angle lens. Whether you’re taking sceneries, selfies or food, there’s a mode for any situation.  For perfect selfies all the time, you can preset your preferred set up in beautification mode. This even works in a group shot so you’ll look your best in both selfie and groufie shots. The Ultra-Snapshot feature also lets you capture moments from sleep mode instantly by double pressing the volume down key twice."

Sure they have a few accounts like   and  , but they are mostly one way channels to promote their products and services.  With Apple continuing to break sales records for every release of its new product, the Cupertino company appears to be openning its doors for better customer interaction. Finally they have just created a new   twitter account to directly address customer questions as soon as possible. The account will be used to share tips and tricks for your iDevice from time to time. So whether you have a software or hardware problem, you can send a tweet to @AppleSupport and you’ll get a response almost immediately. From the looks of it, they are   to various questions on Twitter. It is almost like having an Apple Store Genius Bar on twitter 24/7. Of course, most brands have been doing this across their respective markets but it’s still better late than never.  The Cupertino company is certainly stepping up its customer service. Apart from having an online customer support, they are also in the process of   its Genius Bar appointment system. Instead of walking in and setting a specific time, the Apple Stores in the US will adopt a new “Concierge” service where they will prioritise your request by urgency. For example, a repair for a cracked screen will be attended before a customer having minor software issues.  After registering with the system, they will send a text on estimated wait times and they will text you again once your turn is coming up next. Finally they will text you that your technician is ready and where you can locate them in the store. This is faster than the current appointment system and you can walk around the mall while waiting for your turn.  While we don’t have an official Apple Store in Malaysia, their customer service through their authorised resellers have been pretty good. When they issued recalls for the iPhone 5   and  , the replacement process was hassle-free and in some instances, they even offered a free refurbished replacement."

An experience people everywhere are looking for this year. An experience that will probably define the rest of this year’s technological advancements. It’s an attractive notion, being able to completely immerse yourself in whatever content it is you’re consuming — be it gaming or videos — and if you add the 360-degree element to that, you can essentially travel the world from the comfort of your home. It then comes as no surprise that 2016 is the year of Virtual Reality or VR. Put on a pair of VR goggles and boom, you’re in another world.

But, those devices are expensive and so are the accessories they come with — putting it out of reach for the budget-to-midrange consumer. Well,   wants to help the little guy out with their newly launched   and   — two smartphones that have been purpose built to give users the ultimate VR experience. The Vibe X3 is the better equipped of the two devices, sporting a large 5.5-inch full HD display on the front with a Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor clocked at 1.5GHz, paired with 3GB of RAM and 32 GB of expandable internal storage powering it on the inside. For optics, it gets a 21-megapixel Sony camera on the rear packing PDAF, with an 8MP front-facing selfie shooter. Giving it juice will be a large 3,500 mAh battery. It’s also got a bunch of nifty features like a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and support for 4G LTE. But perhaps the best feature is the dual Dolby Atmos front-facing stereo speakers that has support for Hi-Fi 3.0 thanks to OPA1612 amplifiers from Texas Instruments. Rounding up the duo is the more budget-friendly Vibe K4 Note. Also known as the A7010, this device features a 5.5-inch full HD IPS panel tucked under Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3 on the front. Inside, it packs a modest MediaTek MT6753 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. The camera is a step down from Vibe X3, sporting a 13-megapixel sensor on the rear with PDAF and a fast f/2.2 aperture, plus a 5MP front-facing snapper for selfies. Perhaps the best feature of all is the dual Dolby Atmos front-facing stereo speakers tucked into the top and bottom corners of the relatively thin bezel. It’s awesome that Lenovo decided to strap a pair of front-facing stereo speakers to their mid-range device, what more a Dolby Atmos enabled one. Keeping the lights on is a modest 3,300 mAh battery. Lenovo unveiled something called TheaterMax, a feature baked into both Vibe devices launched today that is supposed to immerse their audience in a widescreen cinematic experience with the aid of the Lenovo ANTVR headset. Both Vibe devices are the first in Lenovo’s line to incorporate the Lenovo VR technology that lets users view any content — be it movies, TV shows or games — on a super-sized virtual screen. How good Lenovo’s VR tech actually is, remains to be seen — and be sure we will definitely be testing these out later. I think it’s pretty cool that they’re trying to bring a good VR experience to a lower-to-mid point in the market. That said, even without the VR component the Vibe devices are pretty attractive handsets on their own. With the Vibe X3 going for RM1,899 and the K4 Note going for RM999, they’re a pretty good deal for the specs, especially that K4 Note with front-facing speakers. Both smartphones will also come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Lenovo’s Vibe UI running on top. The Lenovo ANTVR will be available today onwards for RM99, but you can get it bundled as a free add-on when you purchase either the Lenovo Vibe X3 or the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note at selected stores while stocks last. If you did notice, Lenovo has already   the Vibe X3 at authorised retailers, but this is the first time the K4 Note will be appearing on our shores. I think that being good value as standalone devices is a big plus for these devices as the “VR-enabled” part of Lenovo’s marketing can be treated as a nice little add-on that won’t make the device worse. In a way, it’s kind of like the   and its optional modules — the device’s success doesn’t   hinge on a single gimmicky feature."

These remote controlled flying robots will maneuverer across a track at speeds over 100 km/h and zoom about in different zones that’ll test both the drone and the pilot’s ability. It seems like the World Organisation of Racing Drones (W.O.R.D.) is trying to emulate Red Bull’s Air Race on a smaller scale. The “pilots” of the drones are to fly in a “track” and in between obstacles. The racing drone will also be required to make one mandatory “pit stop”.  A drone racing team comprises of four or more members with a pilot, navigator, pit stop crew or technician and etc. Based on the video that the organizers have just outed, we can kind of put together that these drones will fly through markers – much like Red Bull’s Air Race. Sadly, there won’t be any MacLarens involved. In an extended FAQ, there’s a mention of a “Joker Lane” which would seem to add another thrilling element to it all. We’re expecting it to be something like a flying Mario Kart, with shortcuts and environmental obstacles but with proper safety measures and rules put in place. Two days’ worth of qualifying rounds of the World Drone Prix will begin on the 7  of March with 100 teams vying for the top 32 spots that’ll actually hit the “race track” on the 11  and 12  of the same month. The event will take place at SkyDive Dubai with a winning pool of US$ 1 million (RM 4.14 million) at stake. Dubai Marina will be buzzing next week and eager onlookers can make their way to the “stadium” to watch everything go down.

Samsung Galaxy S7 Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Promotions,Samsung",2016-03-03,": The 2nd round of Galaxy S7 edge pre-order is   at 10AM on 8 March. Can’t wait for the 17th of March to get your hands on a brand new  ? Well, Samsung are launching a pre-order offer for their latest flagship that will let you pick up a Galaxy S7 edge before the official launch on 18 March. Samsung really struck a home run with both their Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge flagship devices. They did such a good job with shoring up the Galaxy S6’s weaknesses that we think it’s a near perfect smartphone. Unfortunately, Malaysia is only getting the edge variant, meaning a higher price of RM3,099 — which is exactly the same price as the Galaxy S6 edge when it first launched. However, if you’re one of the first 1,000 customers to pre-order the device from 7-11 March 2016, Samsung will be throwing in a 20% discount, bringing the price down to RM2,479.20, plus a free 128GB microSD card and an additional year’s extended warranty. If you’re interested in this deal: Upon order confirmation, buyers can collect their Galaxy S7 edge on 17th of March, one day before the offical device launch date of 18th March. Among the duo, the Galaxy S7 edge definitely has the more attractive feature set. Edging out its little brother, the Galaxy S7, the edge variant bundles all the goodies that come with the standard model plus that sexy dual-edge screen and all the features that come with it. To recap, the Galaxy S7 edge proudly displays its 5.5-inch Quad HD (2560×1440 pixels) SuperAMOLED dual-edge curved panel on the front, right above the fingerprint sensor cum home button. Inside, this monster flagship is powered by Samsung’s latest and greatest Exynos 8890 octa-core processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable internal storage via a hybrid SIM tray. Imaging is perhaps the Galaxy S7 edge’s greatest asset with Samsungs brand new Dual Pixel 12-megapixel f/1.7 primary camera unit mounted on the back. It boasts up to 95% brighter photos and a near instantaneous focusing speed in any lighting condition. On the front, the selfie shooter is maintained at 5MP but the camera now gets a faster f/1.7 aperture lens. Other improvements include an IP68 water resistant rating and an always-on display that can that show useful information like your calendar, the time and personalised notifications. It’s also got a bigger battery, rated at 3,600 mAh. If you’d like to find out more about the device, head on over to our   or check out the   why you should pick up a Galaxy S7."

There will be 32GB of storage on-board and it will support further expansion with microSD up to 200GB on its hybrid dual-SIM tray.

A user states that once the smartphone hits some water if you decide to charge it without letting it dry, a warning message will tell you that the charging port is still damp. So no charging till it’s fully dry. Are you mad? Well if you’re ever in the same position, don’t be. Just be thankful the South Korean manufacturers decided to ensure that your device doesn’t go boom or bust by short circuiting. You wouldn’t be too thrilled about being phoneless now would you?

Rory Lee,P9 to be the first Huawei device with Leica lenses?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/03/02/p9-to-be-the-first-huawei-device-with-leica-lenses/,"Android,Evan Blass,evleaks,huawei,Huawei P9,Huawei P9 hands on,Huawei P9 leak,Huawei P9 Leica lens,P9 dual camera,smartphone","Android,huawei,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-03-02,"‘s upcoming   flagship has been a hot topic in the rumour mill with previous rumours suggesting that the device could feature up at least   ranging from a budget “Lite” to a high end “performance” device and even a larger “Plus” variant. There were even rumours of a dual camera setup adorning the back of the device. Thanks to serial leakster  , who shared several hands-on pictures of the upcoming device on VentureBeat, we have confirmation of at least one of those rumours. Care to guess which one? According to the  , the images are that of the standard P9 variant and are courtesy of an unnamed individual who was given some hands-on time with the smartphone. Although the individual refused to be named, @evleaks has been rather accurate in the past with his leaks obtained from anonymous sources. Either way, if the images are really that of the P9, they confirm that the upcoming flagship device will indeed sport a dual-camera setup at the back of the device. From the looks of things, both cameras seem to be sporting the same sensor, which lends credence to an   stating that it would have two 12-megapixel shooters. The overall look and placement of flash plus laser autofocus also lines up with earlier leaked renders of the device, though the smartphone’s design, in general, looks a lot more polished than in the renders. Huawei first debuted their dual-camera setup on the honor 6 Plus — of which the dual-sensors offered useful features like post-capture refocus and simulated aperture adjustment — and are looking to refine that with the P9. Dubbed the second-generation of the honor 6 Plus’ dual camera setup, the P9’s snappers are two 12-megapixel sensors paired with   lenses that should enable even more unique capabilities. It is rather curious, that if those lenses are indeed Leica-made, why the P9 doesn’t feature any Leica branding at all. You’d think that Huawei would want to highlight that as a big feature considering their high profile   with the camera-maker. That said, this may not be the final product as it is completely devoid of any branding, not even Huawei’s own, or markings at all. Worth noting is that these images do line up with a previous leak on   where the P9 was also caught on camera, only that time there was a case over it to mask any design features. They did reveal the placement of key features such as the camera module and fingerprint scanner. As they line up rather perfectly, it is very likely that this leak by VentureBeat is the real deal. Besides images, the source also revealed some specifications of the device. Apparently, the smartphone will feature a 5.2-inch full HD display on the front and be powered by Huawei’s Kirin 950 processor mated with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Giving the smartphone juice is a large 3,900 mAh battery — a rare sight especially in such a thin smartphone with a small screen size. The handset is also said to come with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box, which is unsurprising considering the   also comes with Marshmallow with an EMUI 4.0 skin on top. Pictures also reveal that the P9 will be Huawei’s first flagship that isn’t a Nexus to sport a reversible USB Type-C port. Other goodies include a fingerprint sensor mounted on the back, something that has become a staple on Huawei flagships."

They have just identified a submarine cable system as the root cause of the problem and a fix is underway. Unfortunately fixing a cable lying on the seabed isn’t easy and it will take a month before it gets a full restoration.  This time, it is a different submarine cable. The 6 fibre pair and 7,500 KM long Asia Submarine Cable Express (ASE) located off Singapore is currently identified as the culprit and it affects 2 fibre pairs of TM’s own  . The remaining 4 pairs belong to NTT, StarHub and PLDT.  The repair will require collaborative efforts from consortium members and it is only scheduled to commence on 25th March with expected completion on 31st March. This is also subject to weather and sea conditions which may delay restoration efforts.  As a temporary fix, TM is diverting international traffic to alternative routes to minimise the impact for Malaysian users. While restoration is in progress, expect slower speeds and high latency to international sites that are hosted in the US, North Asia and Europe."

With  , though, this process is slightly less jarring as the quirky company’s selection of wearables boasts battery lives of up to 10 days. To make the switch even easier, two of their newest wearable devices just got a pretty significant price cut. Pebble announced on their blog that the   and P  will both be receiving USD50 price cuts, bringing their price down to USD149.99 (around RM620) and USD199.99 (around RM828) respectively. If you have placed an order at pebble.com on or after 21st January 2016 for a watch affected by the new pricing, Pebble will adjust the charge to match the new price. Simply drop them an email at order@pebble.com with the subject line “Price Adjustment” before 1st April 2016 and include the original order number or the email you ordered with, in your request. That’s a pretty good bargain especially if you take into consideration how fully featured these smartwatches are. But, one of their stand-out features has to be their battery lives. The super thin Pebble Time Round can last a good 2 days on a single charge while the much beefier Pebble Time can achieve about 7 days (realistically 5). This is thanks to the e-Paper display that the Pebble watches use, which is a much more power efficient display technology. Perhaps a dealbreaker for many when it comes to the Pebble line is the lack of a touch-capable display — resorting to buttons to navigate the watch’s UI. Nevertheless, it isn’t enough to pull focus from the other awesome features you get with a Pebble device, like the standard 22mm or 14mm bands that you can interchange with any other standard band of the same size. What’s more, if you’ve never picked up a Pebble device before, you can get 10% off your first device. They also offer free shipping worldwide with every purchase from their  .

In fact, they printed the paper cutout from   and strapped some salvaged propellers from a previous X-Wing flying toy to allow it to be controlled. Then, they hooked everything up to a set of helium balloons and voila a house big enough to carry the little kid inside you to an imaginary Paradise Falls.

On top of that, they have also introduced internet rollover, which allows you to carry forward unused internet quota to the following month.  
 For internet-centric users, you have a choice of 6 plans ranging from 1GB per month and all the way up to 20GB a month. For its entry RM28/month plan, it is slightly more expensive than the current SmartPlan 25 that comes with 1GB of internet, but you get 50mins of calls and 50 SMS bundled in, plus the ability to carry forward 500MB of data. Hitting the middle sweet spot is the RM68/month plan that comes with 6GB of data, 150 mins calls, 150 SMS and you’re allowed to carry forward up to 2GB of internet per month.  For the ultimate data quota, the highest plan at RM238/month offers 20GB of internet, 1000 minutes of calls and 1000 SMS per month. It also allows you to carry forward up to 9GB per month. At the same price, the current SmartPlan 238 offers 12GB of internet (inclusive of 2GB promo) but it comes with unlimited phone calls and SMS.  
 For those who love to talk and text a lot, the “more calls” option is skewed towards unlimited phone calls for its RM68/month plan and above. Similar to its current SmartPlan 75 offering, the RM78/month new Postpaid option also gives you 7GB of data per month (rollover up to 2GB) and unlimited phone calls. For free flow of calls and the most internet, the most expensive RM218/month option gives you unlimited calls, unlimited SMS and 13GB of data.  Like most good things, the highest 3 options are only available for a limited time only. So if you’re interested, you would need to sign up before 30th June 2016.  
 For international travellers, you now have a cheaper option to stay connected. For the “budget traveller”, you can enjoy unlimited instant messaging at RM10/day via selected operators. If you need unrestricted internet access, the “frequent traveller” option at RM36/day gives you unlimited internet usage for a fixed price. Similar to Maxis, you can enable roaming without manual operator selection and you don’t have to worry about bill shocks for connecting to the wrong network partner. It is funny that they are calling it budget and frequent traveller respectively as your travel habits don’t necessary reflect your data consumption.

A simple feature, but a feature WhatsApp has not supported before this. In the past, if you wanted to send a document, a simple “hack” many employed was to change the extension of the file to a supported file type, send it over via WhatsApp and have the other person change the extension back. Now, a simple tap on the paperclip icon would bring up a the option to send docs. But, WhatsApp didn’t just add the option to the existing 6 types of shareable media, instead, they removed the “Video” option to make way for “Document”. This is a great addition as it brings WhatsApp in line with other apps like Telegram that support sending and receiving documents via chat. However, the biggest difference in WhatsApp’s implementation is that you can only send PDF files. Yep, no .docx for you yet, unfortunately. Another little ding in WhatsApp’s new addition is the fact that   devices don’t seem to be supported yet. Our   can receive PDF files sent from   devices, but it can’t send PDF files of its own. The same is also true for our   running  , but that’s less surprising since WhatsApp already   that support for BB10 would stop at the end of 2016. You will still be able to send video via the “Gallery” option as usual, so the only thing you’re missing is the option to record a video directly from the app and share it. WhatsApp didn’t include this particular update in their changelog but this isn’t the first time they’ve “ninja-released” a new feature either. Backup to Google Drive was also a feature that was quietly rolled out before finally being included in the app’s latest changelog as a feature. Then again, seeing how limited and incomplete the feature still seems to be so far, it isn’t too surprising then that WhatsApp decided to keep it off their changelog in the meantime. That said, at least this is a step in the right direction. Kudos!"

They’ve even indicated how much time the detour would add to your total journey. Once you’ve decided, tap the location and hit “Add stop” and Maps will navigate you accordingly. Pretty nifty if that fuel warning light suddenly pops on. Next, Google incorporated some handy 3D Touch shortcuts to the Maps app as well. By hard-pressing on the Maps icon, it will let you either navigate to “Home” or navigate to “Work”. Not nearly as extensive as the 3D Touch features on the Apple Maps app, but useful nonetheless. If you’d like to get your hands on these features, simply update your Google Maps app to Version 4.16.0 in the   and you’re good to go."

Then insert the included VR lens and your smartphone. It was only recently that smartphones manufacturers decided to use the boxes their devices ship in as VR goggles, but it looks like McDonald’s has already caught on to the trend. It is worth noting that this is only a trial run for the Happy Goggles, but there is a chance that these boxes find their ways into more McDonald’s outlets in the future. Although designed to tie in with the Swedish “Sportlov” holiday when many families go skiing, these goggles will also work for any other VR content. It’s nowhere near as technologically advanced as the   or the  , but if it’s as functional and basic as  , I could totally see it working as a distraction for kids.

At 12.9 inches, it can be a little tricky to hold and use in one hand which may have turned some off it. Still, that didn’t stop it from   Microsoft’s entire Surface lineup in Q4 of 2015. If the only thing stopping you from picking one up yourself is the size, we have good news for you because it looks like Apple has plans to launch a 9.7-inch iPad Pro. What everyone thought was going to be the  , may actually turn out to be a smaller iPad Pro as 9to5Mac  . It is said to come with the same monstrous A9X processor, quad speakers and compatibility with the   and   which should translate to pretty stellar performance figures. Despite what seems like a bump up the   hierarchy, 9to5Mac says that the smaller iPad Pro will be priced closer to the  ‘s line of products. If this turns out to be true, it looks like Apple could be replacing the iPad Air line with this tablet, thus tightening and streamlining its iPad lineup. We like this move as it only brings less confusion to buyers, it also usually means that each product would be more focused and precise, allowing it to be clearly differentiated from others in the line. It is also said that Apple could discontinue the first-generation iPad Air and   when this new mini iPad Pro supposedly launches in Apple’s March event. Other things to look out for during that event is the unveiling of the purported smaller 4-inch   plus new   band options. As mentioned earlier, performance should be unaffected, and since they’re bringing over the iPad Pro’s excellent quad speakers and display, media consumption and gaming should be better than ever now that it’s in a more portable form factor. That said, shrinking the size down to 9.7 inches seems like it would go against the design philosophy Apple had for their iPad Pro line where Tim Cook himself said would be a   2-in-1 device. A smaller screen means less real estate for multitasking and productivity tasks, thus hampering its capability as a workhorse. It seems to be an interesting turn of events then, but keep in mind that these aren’t officially confirmed specifications though 9to5Mac has a reputation for being fairly reliable with such information. Nevertheless, do take this with a pinch of salt. What do you think about this move from Apple? Were you anxiously waiting for the iPad Air 3? Drop us a comment down below."

Only 15 hopefuls will be chosen and if you tick all the right boxes, you’ll be able to keep the Redmi Note 3 Pro, free of charge. The smartphone maker has also announced its plan to release the device sometime in April 2016. The registration period only runs for a week and ends on the 6  of March 2016 at 12:00 PM. Here’re details on the Explorers Program: You’re expected to fill in some of your particulars (including your Mi ID), touch bases on how you intend to review the Redmi Note 3 Pro and if it’s possible to finish it up by the 28  of March. Fill up the Google document  . Anyone that has prior experience in reviewing devices has a higher chance of claiming the top 15 while Xiaomi also expects you to provide all social media accounts that you hold – for obvious reasons. If you’re already scrambling to fill out that form, make sure you get it done quickly. Xiaomi’s formidable Redmi starlet is equipped with a 5.5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 processor (renamed from the 618). It’s six cores that are 64-bit enabled run at 1.8GHz while it matches up with an Adreno 510 GPU. The latter allows the Redmi Note 3 to support VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and its functionality is to improve call quality to unprecedented levels.

Just below the dual-LED flash module, you’ll locate a rounded fingerprint sensor that handles any biometric security requests. Meanwhile, the front gets a decent 5-megapixel shutter. In its homeland China, the Redmi Note 3 comes in two versions: a 2GB/16GB model and a 3GB/32GB model. The differences only lie in the smartphone’s RAM and internal storage, otherwise, you’ll find a 4,050mAh battery and MIUI 7 running the show as well.

If you’re unfamiliar with Popcorn Time, this app is the pirate equivalent to   – letting you stream and watch TV shows and movies. The team that prefers to be known as “Pochoclin” present themselves to be the crusaders of the couch potato world. Despite their good-will, the BitTorrent-based client is still very much illegal and we don’t condone its use. Popcorn Time has been in the MPAA’s (Motion Picture Association of America) line of sight since its inception and the main system shut down mainly because of the Association’s lawsuit.

Well, two and a half, if we’re being real here. If it wasn’t clear before it will be now as popular messaging application   is stopping support for several older operating systems, including one that had its latest phone launch in Malaysia less than a year ago. WhatsApp’s official blog reveals that as part of keeping with the times and to give them an easier time to implement more features, the Facebook-owned messaging application will be sticking to Android, iOS and Windows Phone operating systems moving forward. That means that they will be stopping support for Nokia’s S40 and S60 Symbian platforms, old Android 2.1 (Eclair) and Android 2.2 (Froyo), Windows Phone 7.1, and finally   — including   — by the end of this year (2016). This must be disheartening for BlackBerry fans to hear, especially those who decided to pick up the   that was   May of last year. If you couple that with the fact that even BlackBerry themselves seem to be abandoning their proprietary OS with a shift towards Android, things aren’t looking up for BB fans. WhatsApp is one of the most used applications — and the most used instant messaging application based on   — in Malaysia, so terminating support for relatively new devices that run on BlackBerry 10 must be painful for those on the OS. Nevertheless, this is potentially good news for the rest of us who use Android, iOS or Windows Phone devices because since WhatsApp are streamlining their support, we can expect a more focused approach to development. Without the worry of compatibility or limitation across too many platforms, more features can be added to the messaging system. This move by WhatsApp is definitely understandable, as they explain that 99.5% of mobile sales are of devices that run either Google, Apple or Microsoft’s operating systems. It wouldn’t make sense to keep supporting operating systems that almost nobody buys anymore, but couldn’t they held off on the BlackBerry 10 cut at least for awhile longer?"

Well, we hope, better smartphone cameras. Huawei has proven that they can build premium devices, but I’ve always felt that their cameras leave some to be desired.

That said, I find it a little much to think that they would be able to “reinvent” something that has almost been perfected by manufacturers like   and  .

 From the pictures leaked by @evleaks, the design is pretty much the same slab like any other Galaxy Tablets. The only noticable change is the texture of the back which appears to be having a fine dotted grain for the Tab A while the Tab E goes for a faux leather look. Spec-wise, Sammobile mentions that it will likely get a modest 7″ display with a quad-core 1.3GHz processor with just 1.5GB RAM to go.

Since its a flagship, it isn’t surprising that Xiaomi has loaded the new Mi 5 with as much of the cutting edge tech that they could and their efforts have yielded what looks like the most powerful Xiaomi device ever. This 5.15-inch full HD device packs the new Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor with up to 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 128 GB of UFS 2.0 flash storage. Xiaomi claims that the Mi 5 posted a blistering AnTuTu benchmark of 142,084 which completely   anything produced by last year’s flagships. It looks like a seriously fast phone, however, it is worth noting that the base model Mi 5’s processor is clocked at a lower 1.8GHz as opposed to the other two’s 2.15GHz. With their premium flagship, Xiaomi have also introduced an advanced 4-axis optical image stabiliser (OIS) to help the Mi 5’s 16MP f/2.0 primary camera eliminate handshake blur. In their demo video above, they compared it to the unstabilised iPhone 6S and the OIS-enabled iPhone 6S Plus, revealing stunning results. This may well be the best smartphone camera Xiaomi have ever produced. Despite the  ,   and  ‘s excellent build quality, when people think of Xiaomi, they still associate its phones with the kind of cheap plasticky finish that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  Well, Xiaomi is hoping to completely shed that belief with the Mi 5 because it sports a truly impressive build quality."

However, if you did subscribe to Netflix locally, there is no doubt that you would have noticed how  . To gain access to more of Netflix’s catalogue, people defaulted to using a VPN (Virtual Private Network), but Netflix wasn’t too happy about that. In fact, they vowed to   on VPN usage, a vow they have apparently made solid on. If a recent thread on Reddit is to be believed, Netflix is already flexing its VPN-blocking muscles as users in several countries in Europe and even the United States are running into an error when they try to access the streaming service via a VPN. According to user  , when accessing the site with a VPN, users will trigger a streaming error (M7111-1331-5059), which blocks them from accessing the content. A report by GHacks.net also   that they’re experiencing the same problem when accessing Netflix via a VPN, though curiously their error code begins with an H, not the letter M described by u/eduazy, as can be seen in this screenshot. In a world of strict licensing rules and regulations, this move by Netflix stems from their desire to keep their content locked based on geographical location. This makes sense from a business standpoint because if you’re a local broadcaster who as the rights to publish a show, you wouldn’t want some foreign streaming service butting in and taking a cut out of your audience. However, this seems to be an outdated notion. As the world becomes more connected, it doesn’t make much sense to force users to maintain multiple subscriptions just so they can watch a particular TV series. By enforcing such strict licensing rules, broadcasters may have just forced users into pirating something many would gladly pay for if it was in a more accessible medium, as user  : And that’s just one side of the coin. US citizens are also forced to use a VPN to access their local Netflix content simply because many ISPs there throttle their connection speeds when they access the streaming site. Why? All of this is part of a long discussion about Net Neutrality which you can find out more about from Last Week Tonight’s episode about it  , or this informative comic drawn by TheOatmeal  . In a nutshell, Net Neutrality is the idea that all traffic on the Internet should be treated equally by ISPs — something they haven’t been doing in the first place. Instead, some ISPs throttle user’s connection speeds to streaming sites like Netflix to save bandwidth. US netizens who are victims of such throttling use a VPN to disguise their traffic, hiding the fact that it is a video stream from the ISP’s filters, or as  : That way, they can actually use the speed they paid for to view the content that they also paid for — something they can’t do now, thank’s to Netflix’s VPN ban hammer. Granted, it isn’t Netflix’s fault that ISPs are intentionally throttling connection speeds, plus Netflix is only doing what is required in the licensing laws. That said, it is through their actions that many paying customers who have legally (almost) been enjoying the content they paid for may now have to resort to piracy to get their entertainment fix."

Redmond wanted to solve this, by introducing a Windows Bridge platform aka Project Astoria. Through the project, app developers could easily just port over the same Android code that they used to make apps for the Google Play Store for Windows Phone devices. Then, last year rumours flared up that Project Astoria was going bust and now Microsoft has confirmed it themselves. Their statement follows: Acquiring Xamarin is a shortcut but a painful one, considering all the hours spent trying to make Astoria come to life. Microsoft acquisition by default makes Astoria an overkill, as Xamarin does the same thing across not one but three platforms. That kills coding problems associated with porting from Android and iOS in one shot. So sharing the same common code makes a cross-platform app release be a much easier task.

Wait, so it isn’t going to be a new OPPO flagship? It is said that the device will sport a flagship Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor mated to either 3GB or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable (up to 128GB via microSD) internal storage. Those are mighty high-end specs for a device that is supposed to be in the midrange category. What’s more, it is purported to sport a massive 6-inch Quad HD display (2560×1440 pixels) plus a fingerprint scanner. For optics, the device is supposed to pack a 21-megapixel sensor at the back with a 13-megapixel front-facing selfie snapper. Keeping everything running will be a large 3,700 mAh battery. Being a new device, the R9 is rumoured to come with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box though there have been rumours that the device could come with Android Lollipop instead. OPPO had a fairly quiet showing at the recent   in Barcelona, not opting to reveal any devices. Instead, they showcased two technological innovations, the first   — which can fully charge a smartphone in 15 minutes — and a new   with 3-axis image stabilisation. With such a tame MWC, one would think that they would want to come out swinging with a brand new flagship device, not an R series smartphone. An incredibly powerful R device, but an R line smartphone nonetheless. To make matters worse, an R line smartphone would likely mean the same design cues (which have even spread to the  ) — a design which we think everyone has had more than enough of. However, a curious entry on our SIRIM database reveals something rather interesting. The entry, bearing the model number X9009, hit the certification centre awhile back and if we’re looking at the previous Find 7’s model number (X9007) this entry would indicate that this phone is the Find 9, not the R9. This could mean one of two things. First, that OPPO are tightening their product line, cutting off the Find series smartphones and bundling them together with the R series, or OPPO are planning to launch two phones in close succession and only one of those devices will be coming to Malaysia at a time. The former seems to be the more reasonable of the two as the rumoured specifications on the R9 are definitely high end enough to be called a flagship device. But, that also seems unlikely as smartphone manufacturers rarely kill off their flagship line. It would be as if   axed the  series in favour of their   line. Then again, Sony did just axe their Xperia Z line, so I guess anything is possible? Either way, this is all still speculation so take it with the appropriate amount of salt.

Apparently folks in seven countries have been  ’s lab rats, testing the extended “reactions” with positive feedback going all around.  It took Facebook a good year but at least, there will be less misplaced positive vibes and more emotionally appropriate reactions as it launches across Android, iOS and browsers. How will you get to see these new reactions? Just hover over the “Like” button and it’ll expand to show the other reactions, that includes: Love, Haha, Wow, Sad and Angry. Notifications coming in too will change, with it stating someone has “reacted” to a post rather than just “liked” a post. The research that went into fundamentally deciding which reactions would make the cut went as far as looking at people’s one-word reactions on posts (yes, Facebook was spying on us). They also looked at the feelings most displays through their sticker options. Launching a feature across all 1.44 billion active users will take more than a couple of days but be on the lookout for a new update for those on Android and iOS. Users on browsers will just have to patiently wait, as the desktop updates usually just happen gradually. When Engadget asked why “dislike” wasn’t on the list Facebook’s Product Manager had this to say “It would have been too binary”. He adds that the whole point of adding reactions was to make expressions multi-dimensional. We all would appreciate a “dislike” button would we not? Here’s one just for the sake of it!"

Many job advertisements emphasise the fact that they’re looking for creative people, yet quite often, their adverts don’t correctly reflect that aspect of the company. Well, Maxis decided to take a stab at a job advertisement with a short clip which they hope will accurately reflect their company and its values. It was pretty well done, all things considered. It’s simple and straight to the point while also giving potential job applicants a glimpse into the working environment and culture at the Maxis office. Based on the video, we learn that Maxis operates on a free-seating and open office layout — so no tiny cubicles that make you feel cut off from the world — with plenty of large open windows that let in a lot of natural light. With this free-seating arrangement, Marcus the app guy says you can sit next to a different person (or we’re guessing the same person as well) every single day if you wanted “even next to the CEO”. The video also demonstrates the potential learning opportunities a job at Maxis would entail, via professional courses and online learning tools. You’re also encouraged to keep healthy with Maxis’ own fitness trainers and activities including…Mixed Martial Arts? Talk about the best way to relieve stress. But, perhaps best of all is that Maxis encourages people to step up and find innovations that rewrite the rules.

It is an automatic roaming package that activates once you make or receive a call overseas with your local number. In addition to the unlimited calls and SMS, Maxis are also throwing in 500MB of roaming data per day on top of your existing data quota. If this isn’t enough or if you run out of quota, you can purchase additional data at the same rate as it would be in Malaysia. Keep in mind that this plan automatically activates once you have international roaming charges that exceed RM10. Otherwise, you will be charged accordingly. From the looks of it, this is a one-of-a-kind plan by Maxis, bundling unlimited calls and SMS when roaming plus the ability to use your existing local data quota overseas. Comparatively, the other telcos are only offering unlimited daily data roaming for about the same price. Perhaps the best part is that all of this is done automatically, even the selection of roaming networks. Simply turn on data roaming and Maxis will connect to their preferred roaming partners saving you the headache of manually choosing the operators and accidental exorbitant charges when you connect to the wrong network. This definitely eliminates a lot of potential headaches, something you don’t need more of when travelling. The only drawback is that this is exclusive to MaxisONE postpaid plan subscribers, so others on the Maxis network, even MaxisONE Business (but more roaming offers are coming soon), who are not under the MaxisONE postpaid plan banner aren’t eligible for this.

Both showed off their flagship smartphones vying for your attention and, of course, your hard earned cash. But between the two devices, I think the LG G5 is a bigger deal than the Galaxy S7, and here’s why. LG’s G5 showcases a seriously attractive alternative to current smartphone conventions. It is the most innovative product I’ve seen at this year’s Mobile World Congress. The G5 is, essentially, the pioneer in a new breed of smartphones — one that could very well change the way manufacturers make phones and change the expectations we, the consumers, have for smartphones. It blew my mind because of one simple reason: It is, in essence, a modular smartphone and it is because of this that I think the G5 has the edge over the Galaxy S7. I won’t deny that the   and   are absolutely fantastic smartphones —  , even — but, in building the Galaxy S7, Samsung went down a familiar path. Samsung took a successful formula — the Galaxy S6 — and improved virtually every aspect of it. As a result, you get a phone that’s immensely capable but one that does very little to change the game. LG, on the other hand, went all out with their brand new G5. They went with a completely redesigned form from the older  , while at the same time, rewriting the smartphone playbook with its modular design. The modular smartphone, a concept introduced by   in 2013, is still some time away and while the actual vision of a smartphone that you build, customise and upgrade like a Lego set is far from the G5’s modular capabilities, this is a starting point. LG can only improve on this modular idea in future releases. While the LG G5 isn’t completely modular, thanks to its removable bottom panel, you can change the capabilities of the device. On launch day, LG showed two modules — a dedicated camera control module and a Hi-Fi DAC (Digital-to-Analog Controller) plus amp — which demonstrate some of the features you can add to your smartphone."

It’s taken just three years for OPPO to announce Super VOOC that charges a smartphone from 5% to full in 15 minutes. Yup, during the presentation they plugged in a smartphone with a 2500mAh battery and by the end of it, it was all topped up. In the past their fast charging technology was capable of charging a device for five minutes and have it last for 2 hours of talk time to now, charging for five minutes will have it lasting 5 times longer. Low voltage makes all the difference for OPPO’s Super VOOC fast charging, doing away with the need for a voltage converter. They claim that their 5V charge is delivered at a lower rate than Qualcomm and MediaTek’s alternatives with big advantages being that your phone stays cooler, improves efficiency and prevents any sort of battery damage. Seemingly, when you keep the charging temperatures at a minimum, your battery’s longevity will last a lot longer, so fewer worries about old worn out batteries. Faster, safer and cooler. Sounds good to us. It isn’t just all about the charger as the battery has to be a “Super Battery”, utilising some sort of military grade material and there’s some software involved as well. OPPO has said that there will be no limitation as to what port is utilised on a device, so it’ll work on future ports without any issues. Since we’re comparing apples to apples,   does 0 to 80% charge in 35 minutes. They were formerly the fastest but now that’s considered child’s play. We want this now!

The enabler of Tune Talk 8G is based on a technology by Malaysian-based company called SWAG. That’s short for Super WiFi Anywhere you Go. Their solution is to provide the best and fastest internet connectivity possible from the current 4G LTE networks around you. This sounds similar to   on 4G LTE-Advance but it cuts across different telcos. Imagine surfing mobile internet utilising bandwidth from several 4G connections at the same time.

In terms of speed, Tune Talk claims it could deliver up to 160Mbps and an average of 66Mbps during congested peak-hour situations. This was tested around KL Sentral in Malaysia.  To prove its capability, they have uploaded a video speedtest with four 4G LTE connections on Digi, Tune Talk (Celcom), Maxis and U Mobile. We suggest viewing it at full screen at Full HD. While the idea is great, this is far from “8G speeds”, if there’s one defined in the first place. At 160Mbps, that’s faster than what   on LTE-A in Malaysia but it still falls under 4G speeds. Even Qualcomm is making   possible with its latest LTE modem. For TuneTalk to claim 8G is just a marketing gimmick and it is quite misleading since there’s no explanation of what 8G stands for? 4G + 4G = 8G perhaps? Another question mark would be the cost of utilising 4 different telcos. Tune Talk might be able to strike a deal for bulk data access but we doubt Maxis, Digi and U Mobile would let their competitor utilise their LTE bandwidth for cheap."

It seems Chinese company   believes that there shouldn’t be a limit. The company has announced the Vivo Xplay 5 — a smartphone that will be packing a whopping 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM! That’s the biggest RAM ever integrated into a smartphone. The Xplay 5, running Qualcomm’s next-gen Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor, will be packing more RAM than most computers. But, do you   6GB of RAM? RAM, (Random Access Memory), can be thought of as a computer/device’s short term memory. It’s called random-access because this memory is volatile and will not stay saved in a system — it “forgets” as soon as you switch off the power. In a traditional computer, RAM helps with multitasking and the more RAM there is, the more (and more complex) processes a computer can handle. On a desktop/laptop system, a lot of RAM is needed to keep everything running smoothly because we usually use our PCs like workhorses — having multiple applications and browser tabs open at the same time uses RAM. The more RAM you use, your PC will start to slow down and the easiest way to speed things back up again is to either close some tasks to free up memory or completely reboot the computer. This is very much the same case with your smartphone (which is basically a computer that can fit in your palm) so the more RAM your device has, the more processes it can do at one time making it faster and smoother. It will also be able to handle more apps running simultaneously, whether it be in the foreground or the background. By that logic, more RAM is always better and this is true…to a certain extent. You see, to run the current applications that are available for smartphones — even the most intensive games and apps — 3GB of RAM will, in most cases, be more than enough. Even the highest of high-end smartphones today come with 4GB of RAM because that is more than enough to run anything you can throw at it in most cases. 6GB in a smartphone though is bordering on the excess. Would your smartphone be better with 6GB of RAM? Sure! Do you really   6GB of RAM to keep your phone running smoothly? Maybe not. If anything, I think Vivo are cramming 6GB of RAM into their smartphone for nothing more than bragging rights — after all, when the Xplay 5 launches, it will likely be the first smartphone ever to sport 6GB of RAM. And who doesn’t like to be first? That said, having the most RAM does not necessarily equate having the best performance. The key is optimisation. A good example would be  ‘s   which, we found out recently,   pretty much every high-powered smartphone out there on AnTuTu. And the iPhone 6S Plus did so with only 2GB of RAM. In fact, too much RAM could potentially be worse for you as a customer because more RAM usually equates a higher price. That means you will likely have to pay   more than necessary just so you can tell your drinking buddies that you have a phone with 6GB of RAM. Also, more RAM means your phone will using more battery. In fact, battery drain has been a limiting factor to why phones don’t come with bigger RAM already. That means you’ll need a bigger battery to run bigger RAM, which also means additional cost and bulk. So, do you   6GB of RAM? Let us know in the comments."

Now that our cameras are handheld and no longer require tripods, the image stabilisers that live within these lenses are all we require. They’re very important these stabilisers, without them our photos would be a blurry mess. The SmartSensor that   just announced is the first of its kind. Collaborating with MEMS Drive, the duo now has upped the smartphone camera game. Putting all three-axes of stabilisation with their new image stabiliser could mean that OPPO smartphones could be as steady as an SLR camera. In the past, this wasn’t possible as smartphone cameras were usually too small to have a lens-based image stabiliser. Using a lens-based sensor has limitations – only two axes of motion instead of three. Sensor-based stabilisation goes for the full three and is possible with advancements in MEMS tech. The sensor itself is as thin as a couple of sheets of paper and makes quick adjustments with monocrystalline silicon. Image stabilisation in just 15 milliseconds. Another plus point is that the SmartSensor doesn’t suck up much power and the lens doesn’t heat up as much.   could probably make use of this since their smartphones heat up like a hotcake when taking photos but their amazing SteadyShot stabilisation makes up for that – you can see it in action  . Lens-based stabilisation is also 10 times more pinpoint when compared to its alternative. Why does this all matter? Simple – OPPO smartphones will now produce less jittery images on their cameras. As an afternote, Malaysia made its way onto the projector at Barcelona when OPPO looked at some market research. The study by Nielsen aimed to prove that we Malaysians prioritised camera functions the most in OPPO smartphones."

Well, it’s probably because of these tests Boston Dynamics carries out on their robots, where it seems like the only requirement is to be a jerk to this poor bot. What a douche! While it does look like they’re just being complete jerks to these robots, all of this is done with a purpose because machines have historically been terrible at adapting to changing circumstances. Give them a set task to carry out and they’ll do fine, but if you alter one of the variables in the task, the machine will often not be able to figure out what happened. So, while on the surface it seems like the guy is simply bullying the robot, this form of exercise is vital to teach the robot how to adapt to extenuating circumstances, which will help develop more reliable bots in the future. Bots that won’t fail just because they fell over or got stuck in a corner. In this particular case, Boston Dynamics sets the new version of their Atlas robot through multiple scenarios, interrupting it as many times as possible to find out how well it copes with changing variables.

Clearly something Apple wants to avoid. Here is where Bill comes in. The founder of Microsoft said that all the FBI wants is access into ONE smartphone, which is something Apple should be able to do without undermining all their encryption. He also says that there should be safeguards in place (by Apple) when the government accesses such information. While many reported that due to his earlier statement, it meant Bill was siding with the FBI on this matter, but he has since come out and taken a more…moderate stance. Reports indicate that he isn’t fully backing the FBI, calling instead, for a broader discussion as he believes that a balance is important. When asked specifically on his stance, he said that the “courts are going to decide” and also that these “issues will be decided in Congress”. Am I the only one sensing a cop out here? That said, Bill did raise some valid concerns earlier. But if you look at Tim Cook’s open letter, he claims that Apple has put so much effort into their encryption that they’ve put access into their phones out of even Apple’s own hands. That’s why even they can’t crack the terrorists’ iPhone. Whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but what is also interesting is the fact that Apple decided to make their resistance to this court order so public. It does make us wonder whether Apple is using this wave of controversy as a publicity stunt. In fact, the only way Tim could have made his open letter more patriotic is by replacing his periods with bald eagles. Either way, it’s working because this case is on everyone’s lips. Several high profile opinion leaders in the tech industry have spoken up about this issue, among which are Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey. While Mark  ‘s predicament, Jack openly declared his   to #TeamApple. Even eccentric millionaire John McAfee (no points for guessing what he is the founder of) has   the problematic iPhone himself. In fact, John says that he can do so in just three weeks because his crack team is made up of “prodigies” that he believes the FBI simply “would not hire” because they have “mohawk haircuts, ear piercings, tattooed faces and a person who has to smoke weed while working and won’t work for less than a half-million dollars a year”. He’s so confident that not only will he do this for free, he also said that he would eat his shoe on the   (an American television anchor) show if he fails. Seems like a tempting offer? So how important   privacy? The FBI seems to be arguing that it is important up until the point it stops them from saving lives, whereas Apple is sticking to their guns in keeping their customers’ information private. That said, it doesn’t seem like the FBI is asking for that much, after all, it’s just one smartphone right? Well, according to   reported by the Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department is now asking Apple to extract data from another 12 iPhones throughout the US. Are Apple’s concerns validated now? The space between privacy and safety is a tricky line to tread on. On one hand, without privacy, we won’t be able to rest properly with the knowledge that someone could be sifting through all our private information right now. But on the other hand, what if this potentially harmless backdoor into the encryption of our smartphones could save lives? Let us know what you think in the comments section below."
Rory Lee,Xiaomi’s Mi 4S may be the perfect appetiser to the Mi 5’s main course,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/24/xiaomis-mi-4s-may-be-the-perfect-appetiser-to-the-mi-5s-main-course/,"Android,Mi 4S,Mi 4S official,smartphone,Xiaomi,Xiaomi budget,Xiaomi Mi 4S,Xiaomi Mi 4S launch","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2016-02-24,"Ahead of the   flagship’s official launch,   has pulled back the covers of a lower spec smartphone — the Mi 4S — which as it’s name suggests, is an upgrade over the existing  . Bearing the more premium Mi badge, the Mi 4S isn’t exactly a slouch. On the inside, the 5-inch device with a full HD 1080p screen will be powered by a Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor — the same chip powering the LG G4 — mated with 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, doing away with the depressing 16GB storage that usually plagues Xiaomi smartphones. For optics, it gets a 13-megapixel primary camera with Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) plus a dual LED flash to help out in those tricky low-light conditions. On the front, it is a downgrade from the Mi 4 as it only sports a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. That said, keeping the lights on is a larger 3,260 mAh battery which should do pretty well especially since it is only powering a 1080p display. It will also have a fingerprint sensor at the back of the smartphone, like that on the Redmi Note 3. What’s good is that this device will be sporting a glass front and back plus rounded metal rails much like those on the newly announced Sony Xperia X series. The device will also feature dual-SIM support plus 4G with VoLTE support. Xiaomi’s new Mi 4S will come in four colours — White, Gold, Black, and Lavender — and will go on sale in China from 1st March at a price of RMB1,699 (around RM1,100). That’s a pretty good deal considering the specs and if you factor in the fact that it has a premium metal and glass build, this phone is a steal. Unfortunately, this smartphone is currently only available in China with no word on outside availability yet."
Rory Lee,Xiaomi’s latest flagship smartphone is a stunning piece of kit,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/24/xiaomi-mi-5-official-launch-mwc-2016/,"Mi 5 MWC 2016,mobile world congress 2016,MWC 2016,Xiaomi,Xiaomi launch,Xiaomi launch MWC 2016,Xiaomi Mi 5,Xiaomi Mi 5 Launch","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2016-02-24,"The final flagship from MWC 2016 has dropped and it is from Chinese smartphone makers   with their brand new   — and it’s a beautiful beast. Several days before the official announcement, Xiaomi has been teasing the capabilities of the Mi 5,   where they posted pictures that their president Bin Lin had taken with the Mi 5 on his Lunar New Year holiday. They also launched a series of videos featuring record holders blitzing through tasks like jumping rope and solving a Rubik’s cube, emphasising the Mi 5’s speed. We also have the failed attempts from Hugo Barra, but I don’t think that has anything to do with the smartphone’s speed — at least I hope not. But now, we finally get to see if the Mi 5 really lives up to the expectations Xiaomi has set for it. For starters, the Mi 5 will sport a 5.15-inch full-HD near-bezel less Sunlight display on the front which Xiaomi seems to think makes a big difference over the 5.1-inch and 4.7-inch displays on both the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 6S. On the inside, it will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest next-gen Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor paired with either 3GB or 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and a choice of 32GB, 64GB or 128GB of internal UFS 2.0 flash storage which Xiaomi says posts a blistering AnTuTu score of 142,084. The key point here is it doesn’t sport a microSD expansion slot, but with a 128GB option, things aren’t so bad. For optics, the device gets a 16MP rear-facing f/2.0 Sony IMX298 camera that sits flush at the back with PDAF, while a 4-megapixel 2 micron large pixel selfie shooter graces the front. The primary camera features a 4-axis OIS, which you can check out in this video: Other features include a front fingerprint scanner, dual-SIM, LTE-Advanced and VoLTE support, Bluetooth 4.0 and support for NFC with MIUI 7 running on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow preinstalled. Keeping everything running is a moderate 3,000 mAh battery with Quick-Charge 3.0 via USB Type-C. 
 One unique thing about the Xiaomi Mi 5 is the fact that it sports what Xiaomi calls “3D ceramic glass” which forms the back of the phone. At the front it’s glass as usual with a metal frame holding both panels together. It also has a slight curve on the back much like the new Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy Note 5 including Xiaomi’s own  . The device will come in three colours — Black, White and Gold (which has an exclusive back etched design) — and prices are as follows: These devices will be available in China starting 1st March with global availability coming soon."

A curious launch because the   Performance featured a set of killer specs that many felt should have found their way into the Xperia Z6 instead. This led to wild speculation that Sony could be replacing their   series, speculation, that if this recent post by   is to be believed, could prove true. Can’t read German? Well, neither can I but thankfully someone on Reddit does and according to user  , the message translates to: “There will be no Z6″. The plot thickens. Can we believe this piece of information? Well, before deciding, it is worth pointing out several key factors in said comment. The first is the fact that when they said that there would be no Z6, they did not specify a time frame. For example, they didn’t say that there would be no Z6  . Without the time quantifier, it becomes hard to take what they say with absolute certainty because for all we know, they could have simply meant to say that there would be no Z6 launched here at the Mobile World Congress — which opens up the possibility of a Z6 further down the road. Secondly, they mentioned that the new X series is a “modified concept that meets the needs of our users more”. Note the keyword “modified” and the absence of any indication that Sony was “replacing” the Xperia Z series. Finally, when we spoke to a Sony Mobile representative during the launch of the Xperia X series yesterday, he said that it wasn’t a replacement, but a product that focuses on different consumers. Possibly a regurgitated scripted answer, but we thought was worth mentioning anyway. But, for the sake of covering our bases, let’s assume that yes, Sony did replace the Xperia Z with the Xperia X series, would that be such a bad thing? Well, from our hands-on, we don’t think so. The Xperia X is a series of handsome looking devices — all of which feature a robust and curvier design language, departing from the sharp and prickly edges of the  . The Xperia X Performance felt exceptionally good with its premium brushed metal finish which is refreshing compared to the tired glass backs on the Xperia Zs of old. If performance is what you’re worried about, we’ve got nothing to complain as the top end Xperia X Performance packs a wallop with the all new Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor with 3GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of expandable storage. It’s got a whole bunch of other flagship-worthy goodies too including a reasonable 5-inch full HD display (no 4K, sorry). It’s also got a top-of-the-line 23-megapixel primary snapper packing the 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS mobile sensor, 5x- Clear Image Zoom and a Sony f/2.0 G Lens that runs up to a mind-boggling 12,800 ISO. What’s more, you get a 13-megapixel selfie camera with a wide 22mm lens on the front. Not a slouch at all then. In fact, we think it’s a pretty worthy successor to the old   that we weren’t  . That said, do keep in mind that this can’t really count as an official statement as there is the off chance that the person who replied to the comment is a rogue social media handler, so take it with a pinch of salt until we get a proper word from someone more credible. What do you guys think of this? Will you miss the Xperia Z series if the Xperia X does end up replacing it? Do you think the Xperia X is a worthy successor? Drop us a comment down below."

We use our senses to navigate the world around us but are often too preoccupied and stuck on our screens to experience life. Our reliance on these screens at all times of day are disruptive (not in a business sense) – they destroy some relationships and friendships; they sometimes are a matter of   and overall is just a nasty habit. The disruption stops here with Sony Mobile’s Xperia smart products that’ll help you be more hands-free, eyes-free and voice smart when interacting with these devices. Smart assistants if you will. Sony’s first device will live in your ear and boss you around to get your life together. Going as the Xperia Ear, this Bluetooth earbud will converse with you via verbal commands; making it easier to navigate through your schedule, and go fully hands-free while checking through some of your smartphone’s typical features – weather and news. Since it’s your personal assistant, it’ll help you make calls, search the internet, put speech to text and even guide you to locations through GPS. All without looking at that darn screen of yours. The Xperia Ear is compatible with Android devices and will be controlled via a host app where you’ll be able to tweak settings based on your personal preference, it’ll also run you through a how-to the first time you use it. Made out of silicone, Sony wants you to have this in your ear throughout the day. It’s handy that it’s rated IPX2 and has a (claimed) all-day battery life. The earbud will arrive in a Graphite Black colour while you’ll charge the earpiece in its included case that doubles as a charger. Expect it to hit markets in Summer of this year. Still in an early concept stage, the Xperia Eye is a handy ultra-portable camera that’ll follow you wherever you want it to. Its size resembles an inhaler and attaches via a clip mechanism – usually to a piece of clothing. You can wear it as a necklace too. This is a deliberate showcase of Sony’s imaging technology in a small 360-degree spherical camera. Commands are conducted through voice or facial recognition – which is a bit freaky but its main purpose is to be always ready to take photos of the moments and people around you. A projector isn’t all that new but a projector that responds to touch is something that will blow many people’s minds. Not only that, it also reacts to voice and gestures – much like a smartphone. No, this isn’t Sony’s first rodeo when it comes to portable projectors as we talked about the Portable Ultra Short Throw Projector before. But this takes the cookie. More projection here but it’s more about the personal assistant side of things with the Xperia Agent. The device is essentially your personal EVE (see WALL-E), providing you with necessary info and controls to your smart home appliances. You’ll talk to it as it uses the same Sony voice technology and it takes off from there. Equip with a built-in camera and projector for screen gestures, we foresee the Xperia Agent making its way to homes around the world."

Apart from the glam devices launched at MWC 2016, the big yellow company has also released the world’s first thermal imaging smartphone with the CAT S60. Not only it gives you cool predator vision, it is built to last exceeding military spec. The main highlight of course is its FLIR Thermal Camera. With a live thermal imaging, it can show heat sources as indicated in red on the screen. You’ll also get real-time temperature reading in real time. The camera is so sensitive that it could pick up heat marks left behind by my palms on a flat surface. Some of the real life application include checking for leaks in the house, finding heat sources and spotting for people in life rescue situations. For security guards, they could use it to see intruders in the dark even through thick smoke. The possibility is endless and it works effectively with a range up to 100 feet (30 metres). The CAT S60 just screams rugged all over with a strengthened die cast frame and it gets a carbon-fibre look back. Designed like a power tool, it feels chunky in the hands and it is built to withstand drops onto concrete surfaces from up to 1.8 metre high. I wanted to put their claims to the test but was told to try that on production units since the one I’m holding is one of the 6 working prototypes in the world. Over at the front, it gets extra protection with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and the display also supports glove and wet finger tracking. Looking for the best waterproof smartphone? It can’t get better than this. While the CAT S60 has the same ingress protection rating of IP68, it is able to submerge under water up to 5 metres deep for a full hour. Move aside Sony, this is the world’s most waterproof smartphone. CAT isn’t holding back on its waterproofing capability, so you can confidently take this to take photos and videos underwater. The underwater camera (yes, that’s how they are calling it) is a 13MP shooter with dual-LED flash, while the front gets a 5MP camera. If you plan on taking this beyond 2 metres deep, just remember to shut off its speaker and microphone grill by flipping the tiny switches with your fingernail. As a smartphone, the CAT S60 is no slouch. While the front gets a modest 4.7” HD 720p display, it is powered by a decent Snapdragon 617 Octa-Core processor with 3GB RAM and 32GB of on-board storage. Keeping the lights on is a huge 3,800mAh capacity battery, which should be more than enough to last overtime shifts. Being a 2016 device, it runs on Android Marshmallow out of the box. The CAT S60 will be available later in the year and it will be priced at US$599, which is around RM2,524. Come hell or high water, this phone is built to survive anything. This is no doubt the Chuck Norris of phones."
Rory Lee,Test footage from Samsung’s new Gear 360 is pretty impressive,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/test-footage-from-samsungs-new-gear-360-is-pretty-impressive/,"360 degree camera,360-degree video,MWC 2016,Samsung,Samsung 360 video,Samsung Gear 360,Samsung Gear VR,Samsung MWC 2016,Samsung VR","Cool stuff,Mobile Accessories,Others,Samsung",2016-02-22,"Remember this little  ? It’s tiny and one of the most consumer friendly 360-cameras on the market — it even has its own tripod! Looking sweet is one thing, but what most of  you are concerned with is how it performs when shooting 360-degree video. Wonder no more as Samsung have uploaded several videos demonstrating the shooting and stitching capabilities of their tiny Gear 360. It’s pretty impressive. The quality isn’t too bad for a device that small and what really shines is how well everything is stitched together — probably due to that overlapping FOV (each lens shoots in 195-degrees). It’s not perfect, as is evident from the little distortion near the skier’s arms but overall its a pretty good effort. Looking at this second video showing a bunch of ballerinas, the stitching is even better, almost eliminating distortion. The same can be said for the freestyle soccer too, but if you pay attention you can see a dark ring (almost like a black rainbow) around the area where the video overlaps. To recap, the Gear 360 utilises two 15-megapixel cameras strapped back-to-back. It has the ability to shoot just under UHD quality which is pretty high, plus it takes 30-megapixel still photos. Each lens has an f/2.0 aperture so that should help out with low-light photography."

The Liquid Jade 2 sports something called a hybrid storage functionality which makes use of cloud storage to keep your phone clutter free. Ring any bells? Yep, this implementation isn’t exactly new especially if you’re familiar with the Kickstarter phone the Nextbit Robin. Much like the Robin, it seems that the Liquid Jade 2 will utilise this same functionality to upload unused apps to the cloud for archiving and mass storage, but while the Robin gives you 100GB of cloud storage, Acer is throwing out a whopping 1TB of storage. What remains to be seen is if Acer’s implementation will be as effective and practical as that on the Robin — which has received a lot of praise for their particular innovation. Besides that, the Liquid Jade 2 features decidedly average specifications for a flagship as the 5.5-inch device sports a full-HD AMOLED panel with 100% NTSC colour gamut on the front. Inside, it’s powered by a Snapdragon 808 processor mated with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of local storage. For optics, the Liquid Jade 2 packs a 21-megapixel PDAF sensor with dual-LED flash and support for 4K video recording. Selfies are taken care of by a front facing 8-megapixel snapper.

Packing a not-at-all unreasonable spec sheet, the Lenovo Vibe K5 and K5 Plus are pretty decent options in the low-end of the market. The better spec-ed Vibe K5 Plus gets a 5-inch 1080p full HD display at the front while being powered by a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor on the inside mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage (microSD up to 32GB). Keeping everything running is a 2,750 mAh removable battery, which should delight power users. For optics, it gets a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 5MP front-facing snapper for selfies. It will support dual SIM and be LTE enabled. On the Software side, Lenovo is streamlining their skin of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop to remove the excess and keep everything running smoothly — important when you consider they have to rely on a Snapdragon 616. It is unfortunate that it doesn’t come with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, though, but we hope that it will receive an update somewhere down the line. Other goodies include a Dolby Atmos sound software plus two rear-facing speakers and a relatively nice build with good use of metal — something that is still relatively rare at this end of the market. The lower-end K5 simply drops the processor down to an octa-core Snapdragon 415 and the full HD display goes down to an HD display.

Most of us are blessed with the tools that we rely on to connect ourselves with the world. An idealistic view would be equal opportunity for everyone in the world. Who knows the unlocked potential and opportunities of these individuals that stand outside these privileged circles. The Android One program wants to realise a dream that people all over the world will have access to a smartphone and this is the highest specced smartphone yet to come out of the program. This is the GM Plus 5 and with it, people are going to be ready to take on the technological world. That’s just one reason why we’re looking at the General Mobile 5 Plus. The other is because it’s actually a smartphone that I’d consider getting for myself – anything that runs pure vanilla would warrant a second glance. Coming out of Turkey, this device pushes a Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution on its 5.5-inch screen. You’d be surprised that despite being a part of the Android One program; the manufacturer paid attention to the details. Off the bat, you’ll notice that the glass up front has a 2.5D taper all around while protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4. All its internals sit in a metal chassis and the rear is encased by a textured back cover that comes in four colours. Multitasking shouldn’t be a bother with Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 Octa-core chipset mated to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. If you’re a memory hog, you’ll rest easy knowing that there’s a microSD slot for expandable storage. For all things photography, the primary and secondary shutters are both 13-megapixels. They’re also both equip with autofocus and flash for those low light shots: dual-flash on the rear and a single-flash on the front. General Mobile quotes that the camera sensors were tuned by the folks at DxOMark which mean they took imaging seriously. Juicing all its internals is a 3100mAh lithium ion battery which charges via a USB Type-C port. And did we mention it supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0? Some OEMs should be embarrassed by now. Being an Android One device automatically allows the GM 5 Plus to run the latest version of Android, so you can expect Marshmallow 6.0.1 on this feature pack device. The GM 5 Plus will also be guaranteed Android updates for 18 months from the time of release. Adding to its spec sheet is support for 4G LTE connectivity up to Cat7.

The two excel at different things and are naturally used to things being a certain way. So when you design a smartphone’s software, you tend to gear your UI to certain elements that typically reflect the wants and needs of your consumer. LG says they’ve decided to change a key UI feature because they’ve done the necessary market research. After looking at the changes they’ve made in person, we can only say one thing: We want to see see those findings for ourselves – cause we’re not sure what they did was a good idea. A trend that they began with the LG V10 was a secondary ticker that gave the phablet an “Always On display” – it was small – unlike the LG G5 that uses its main display to show the “Always On” feature. Fortunately, if you’re not a fan you can turn it off in the settings on the LG G5 but a 0.8% per hour battery decrease shouldn’t hurt much. If you looked hard enough at the main photo of this post, you’d have probably picked it up. LG’s Marshmallow skin illustrates that they’re not playing small anymore and it shows with the omission of an app drawer. Say whatttttttt? Yeah, they’ve joined the ranks of other Chinese OEMs that opt to go drawer-less. It makes things simple but it’ll be unfamiliar waters for most people that love how Android typically works. That all might change with reports that Android N going drawer-less itself but we’ll see how people adapt to the LG first before passing off conclusions. Q slide is nowhere to be seen too, so your notification pulldown menu is going to much cleaner. There’s also no more multi-window. The menus are also a lot whiter, moving away from the darker themes. Removing all that allows LG’s UI to be much less bloatware-ish but if you’re getting personal, I, myself prefer to have an app drawer to keep things neat. Something that’s supposedly the aim of slimming down the UI, making it the “simplest kind of interface, and make it as intuitive as possible”. The reasoning for choosing an Android device is usually when you want an open play box but when you start changing a system and it starts “looking” a lot like iOS – by coincidence or otherwise – people are likely to flip. If you don’t know much about the LG G5, you can check out our announcement post  . One thing is for sure, LG is going big but will they going home because of it?"

This time around they’ve unveiled the Desire 530, 630 and 825, with what they call a “micro splash effect” which peppers the phones with sprinkles of colour. Whether or not you actually like them, is pretty much a matter of taste. However, its what’s ticking inside that makes the phones pretty basic. The Desire 530 to start has a quad-core 1.1Ghz Snapdragon 210 processor mated to 1.5GB RAM and 16GB storage expandable via MicroSD.

Arif Lee,Sony updates its smartphone lineup for 2016 with the Xperia X series,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/sony-xperia-series-xa-x-performance-mwc-2016-launch/,"Android,Exmor,mobile world congress 2016,MWC 2016,Predictive Hybrid Autofocus,Sony,Sony Camera,Sony imaging,Sony Mobile,Sony Mobile World Congress 2016,Sony MWC 2016,sony xperia,sony xperia X,Sony Xperia X Performance,Sony xperia XA,Xperia X,Xperia X Performance,Xperia XA","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sony",2016-02-22,"In recent times,   has failed to capture the magic of their glory days when the Xperia brand is seen as a leader in the smartphone market. Today, the brand struggles to produce phones than are on par with its competitors. Sony needs to do something drastic and start making devices that consumers can look forward to if they want to stay relevant. Their Marshmallow concept is the first step in the right direction but the devices that Sony come up with have to be really special. However, if the three new Xperia phones Sony revealed at MWC16 is anything to go by, the brand still has a long way to go. Let’s see what the new-for-2016 Xperia X range has to offer and you tell us if these three devices are capable contenders against the competitors. 
 At the top of the range, we have the Xperia X performance. The device features a 5-inch TRILUMINOS Full HD (1920 x 1080) display complete with Sony’s propriety, and very good, X-Reality and Dynamic Contrast Enhancement image enhancement technology on board. The Xperia Performance boasts a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 3GB RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage that’s expandable with microSD up to 200GB. Interesting to note here is that the 64GB option will be a dual-SIM variant while the 32GB unit will have a single SIM slot. The Xperia Performance also includes a fingerprint scanner that’s integrated with the side mounted power button and support for high-res front facing stereo speakers with a dedicated dedicated DAC (Digital Audio Converter). For taking pictures, there’s a 23-megapixel camera with an 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS for mobile sensor, 5x Clear Image Zoom, Sony F2.0 G Lens and a mind-numbing 12800 ISO. On the front, you get a 13-megapixel camera with a 22mm wide-angle lens. Powering the Xperia X Performance is a 2,700mAh battery with a claimed two-day run time. The Xperia X Performance also gets Sony’s trademark water and dust resistant capabilities with an IP68 rating. The Xperia X shares many of the specs of the Xperia Performance including the same screen size and resolution, the same front and rear cameras, as well as the same 3GB RAM and 32GB and 64GB storage options. The major difference is in the processor and the battery. The Xperia X comes with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 650 processor and a slightly smaller 2,620mAh battery. Unlike the Xperia X Performance, the Xperia X does away with Sony’s legendary water and dust-resistance capabilities and front-facing stereo speakers. The Xperia XA is Sony’s entry level X-series smartphone. It has a 5-inch HD (1280 x 720) display and a budget 64-bit MediaTek MT6755 processor with 2GB of RAM and only 16GB of internal storage. Fortunately, the memory is expandable with microSD up tp 200GB. In the camera department, the Xperia XA gets a 1/3-inch 13-megapixel rear camera while at the front, you get an 8-megapixel wide-angle shooter. The battery is the smallest of the range as well, at only 2,300mAh but Sony still claims a 2-day run time thanks to smart power management. Let this prices serve as a mere indication as Europe pricing has always been higher when compared to local pricing in Malaysia. Even so, what do you guys think would be an appropriate price range for these three devices? Also, pleases share with us any other thoughts on Sony’s new range. Let us know in the comments."
Cheryl Bates,Lenovo’s TAB3 series are tablets on the cheap,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/lenovos-tab3-series-are-tablets-on-the-cheap/,"Android,Android 6.0,Lenovo,lenovo tab3 10 business,lenovo tab3 7,lenovo tab3 8,lenovo tab3 tablets,mobile world congress 2016,MWC 2016,mwc lenovo,tablets","Android,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-02-22,"‘s on a roll this time at  , releasing a brand new line of Android tablets under their “TAB3″ line. There’s a total of three relatively affordable devices, all running off   and there’s even one for business users. The TAB3 basically comes in three different flavours, 7 and 8 inch variants as well as a 10 inch “business model” for those who need a mobile work horse. All the devices come in under $200 so pricewise, they’re fairly competitive for what they’re offering. The smallest of the bunch, the TAB3 7 is a 7 inch tablet (if the names weren’t a dead giveaway) with a 1024 x 600 IPS display, 1GHz quad-core MediaTek processor under the hood mated to 1GB RAM and 16GB storage expandable via MicroSD. You also get a 5 megapixel rear and 2 megapixel front camera combo and LTE connectivity but not much else.  The TAB3 7 starts at $129 (about RM 542). The TAB3 8 on the other hand is its larger but cheaper brother, sporting a 1280 x 800 IPS display at 8 inches. Its essentially the same as the TAB3 7 except it doesn’t come with LTE connectivity for the baseline $99 (about RM416) device, but if you do want LTE be prepared to shell out an extra $50 for that model. Last but not least is the TAB3 10 Business. Its understandably got a bump up compared to its siblings because if you’re picking up this one, we’d expect you would want to get work done on it. Here you will get a 10 inch 1080p IPS display with a 1.3Ghz quad-core MediaTek processor under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM and 32GB expandable storage via MicroSD. You also get a 8 megapixel rear camera and 5 megapixel front snapper. The device will be running Android 6.0 with Android for Work, dual-band AC WiFi but no LTE, Like the Tab3 8, you’ll need to tack on an extra $50 for the LTE model, but there’s also the option for more RAM and storage (3GB RAM/64GB storage) with the $299 variant.  The TAB3 10 Business is also splashproof, so does that technically make it coffee resistant? The TAB 7 and 8 will hit the shelves this June, while the TAB3 10 Business will be available starting this July."
Rory Lee,Samsung’s new Gear 360 is a sweet looking 360-degree camera and I want one,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/samsungs-new-gear-360-is-a-sweet-looking-360-degree-camera-and-i-want-one/,"360 degree camera,mobile world congress 2016,MWC 2016,Samsung,Samsung 360 camera,Samsung Gear 360,Samsung Gear VR,Samsung launch,smartphone,The Next Galaxy,TheNextGalaxy","Mobile Accessories,Samsung",2016-02-22,"Besides the gargantuan launch of  ‘s new flagships, they’ve also bundled a sweet little 360 camera called the   just to spice things up. And I’m not kidding when I say sweeeeeeeet. It looks like something cute and cuddly out of a children’s novel that you just know is going to be made into a million plush toys and its own movie. The design philosophy is pretty obvious here: It’s clearly a golf ball. Okay, maybe Samsung didn’t have a golf ball in mind when they designed it (or did they?) but you can’t help but draw similarities. It’s white, round and comes perched on its own…tee… ahem, tripod, so that it can stand all by its lonesome. This ball of cuteness comes with two fisheye lenses mounted back to back — both sporting its own dedicated 15-megapixel CMOS sensor — and is designed to let users “become the creator of their own virtual reality content”. These 15MP sensors allow users to capture high-resolution 3840×1920 360-degree video at 30 frames per second and 30MP still images. If you don’t want the full 360-degrees for some reason even though you bought a 360-degree camera, you can also shoot 180-degrees using just one of the two 15MP sensors. The Gear 360 offers Bright Lens F2.0 which creates “high-resolution images even in low-light conditions” so that can be useful if you want to film, say, a sunrise from the top of the Himalayas. Although it comes with its own tripod, it doesn’t mean that you will be limited to it and it alone as the Gear 360 supports the standard tripod thread mount that is also compatible with a wider selection of accessories and mounts. It also has support for a microSD card (up to 128GB) and is IP53 certified dust and water resistant. So not really a tool to film your underwater explorations then. That said, it also has a tiny 0.5-inch 72×72 PMOLED display and a record button at the top. On one side, it has a menu and back button that doubles as a Bluetooth and power button respectively. Keeping everything running is a removable 1,350 mAh li-ion battery which brings the total weight of the entire device to 153g. The thing about Samsung’s launch during the Mobile World Congress is that they’re not only launching a smartphone or a camera, they’re launching an ecosystem. A Galaxy if you wish. They, along with several other tech giants, have realised that diversifying is the key — selling you more stuff that you might not need but you definitely want. I can’t help but want this little Gear 360 because it opens up a whole host of content creation possibilities. Just imagine GoPro cameras. Previously the niche product of extreme sports aficionados, GoPros are now a staple equipment for any creative content creator and the Gear 360 has the potential to be the next GoPro."
Rory Lee,Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge: The perfect smartphone,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/22/samsung-galaxy-s7-and-s7-edge-official-launch-mwc-2016-the-perfect-smartphone/,"Galaxy S7 official announcement,Galaxy S7 official launch,mobile world congress 2016,MWC 2016,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-22,"Technology has made leaps and bounds in terms of improvements over the years with the ultimate goal of creating the perfect piece of tech. While the development of the smartphone has somewhat slowed especially in terms of hardware specifications and features, the challenge is now in refinement. In making something good, even better, in making something great…perfect. But is perfection what we really want? There is no denying that the    /  is a beast of a smartphone with the best of everything, a great build and a fantastic camera. How do you improve on something that’s already so good? You refine it. That’s exactly what Samsung did with the S6’s successor, the   and  . The Galaxy S7 has a gorgeous 5.1-inch Quad HD (2560×1440 pixels) SuperAMOLED display panel (577ppi). The Galaxy S7 edge has the same screen resolution but on a larger 5.5-inch display. On the inside, both variants will get either the next generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor, clocked at 2.15GHz, or Samsung’s own next-gen Exynos 8890 octa-core processor, clocked at 2.3GHz, depending on the market (Malaysia will probably get the Exynos version). Both these chips will be mated to 4GB of RAM and either 32/64GB of internal storage. This translates to a 30% improvement in CPU performance and more than 60% improvement in GPU performance over the previous Galaxy S6 and S6 edge. Keeping everything looking pretty is Samsung’s TouchWiz UI skinned on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Samsung has also reintroduced microSD support in the S7 and S7 edge with a card slot that takes cards up to a whopping 200GB. For optics, both Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will get Samsung’s new Dual Pixel 12-megapixel f/1.7 camera. Dual Pixel sounds like a fancy term, but it is basically an upgrade to the Phase Detection AF found on the Galaxy S6, where thanks to this technology, every pixel is focusing on the image at the same time. Samsung says that this translates to a near instantaneous focusing speed even in low light conditions. What’s more, because this 12MP sensor uses bigger 1.4 micron pixels (up from 1.12 micron) and a faster f/1.7 lens, the Galaxy S7 is supposed to give you 95% brighter photos. The Galaxy S7 gets a 3,000 mAh battery while the Galaxy S7 edge with the larger display gets a 3,600 mAh which is a big increase from the Galaxy S6’s 2,550 mAh and S6 edge’s 2,600 mAh battery. For charging, the S7 and S7 edge supports Samsung’s fast-charging technology as well as wireless charging which also now supports fast charging. Besides that, the Galaxy S7 also has a fingerprint scanner located under its home button with support for Samsung Pay. I’m sure many will be happy about the return of the microSD card slot. This popular feature that was missing from the Galaxy S6/S6 edge is making its return in the Galaxy S7/S7 edge. However, this improvement comes in the form of a hybrid SIM tray — you will have to pick either a single SIM and microSD or dual SIM and no microSD. A bit of a bummer, but at least you have the option of expandable storage now. The Galaxy S7/S7 edge is now water-resistant up to IP68 which means that while you’re not encouraged to take it for a swim, it will survive an accidental drop in the pool. The open ports on the S7 and S7 edge have a special water-repellent coating that negates the need for fiddly flaps and port closures (a major bane for older IP-rated Samsung phones). This is nice and makes the design of the S7 and S7 edge sleek and clean. Also new is the always-on display feature that uses minimal power to show basic useful information and notifications like calendar appointments, the time, among other things. Samsung have also included some dedicated gaming features. One of which is called the “Game Launcher”. What it does is let you control how you want to play your games — better graphics and higher performance, or lower graphics and longer battery life — as well as shuts off background tasks and alerts when you’re gaming so you are not interrupted by notifications. Heat build-up is always a major issue with Samsung devices. To fix the issue, Samsung has build into the S7/S7 edge a water cooling system that consists of copper piping filled with water surrounding the processor to help disperse heat during intense usage or gaming sessions. While the Galaxy S6 edge was a novel concept, we didn’t like the limited functionality and features of the edge screen display on the S6 edge. Samsung has sorted this out and increased the function and features of the edge screen display on the Galaxy S7 edge. Among these are the increased edge screen real estate which translates to the device being able to display more information and more functionality for the edge screen. You have extensive edge features such as an updated People edge, Apps edge and Tasks edge. You also have access to a number of Quick tools like a ruler, a compass and a flashlight all from the edge screen. These improvements look to be identical to the ones bundled with the Galaxy S6 edge’s   so be sure to check that out if you want to know more. Perhaps the most significant refinement is the build. Sure, design-wise, it looks almost exactly the same as the previous Galaxy S6/S6 edge, but they did make a lot of the necessary improvements we yearned for in the old one. Remember the curved back that helped you hang on to your slippery  ? Yeah, that’s now on the Galaxy S7/S7 edge too — a welcomed improvement over the flat-backed Galaxy S6/S6 edge. Did I hear someone say camera hump? Well, thanks to that new Dual Pixel sensor, Samsung have managed to almost entirely shave it off. In many ways, although it pains me to say this because I’m far from being their fan, Samsung   how to do hardware. A quick look at their unbelievably polished flagships of last year should give you more than enough of a hint as to how good they are at building a phone, yet they’ve managed improved on it even further with the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. We tried to find faults in the S7 and S& edge, but try as we might, we couldn’t find much."

They have significantly improved performance, features and a whole bunch of other goodies. But the big question is: Would you get one? Well, here are 7 big reasons why you definitely should and why the S7 is a worthwhile upgrade over the S6. The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are smartphone powerhouses. Powered by either a next-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core SoC or Samsung’s very own next-gen Exynos 8890 octa-core chip (Malaysia is likely to get the Exynos version), the S7 and S7 edge surely pack a punch. Paired with 4GB of RAM and 32 or 64GB internal memory (expandable via microSD up to 200GB), the Galaxy S7 duo sees a 30% bump in CPU as well as over 60% bump in GPU performance from the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge. That’s a massive amount especially if you consider how powerful the previous Galaxy already are. What’s more, the S7 and S7 edge is optimised for serious mobile gaming with dedicated features to help you maximise your smartphone gaming experience. The S7 and S7 edge has got a dedicated “Game Launcher” function that lets you decide how you want to game — maximum power and FPS or maximum battery life and lower FPS — on the fly. What’s more, the feature also lets you mute all notifications so you wont be distracted when you’re getting serious mobile game time. The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge has among the best, if not the best cameras you can get on a smartphone. The S7 and S7 edge looks o continue this tradition with a brand new 12-megapixel Dual Pixel sensor mated to a super-fast f/1.7 aperture lens. The new sensor delivers lighting-fast focusing — even in low-light. It also takes 95% brighter pictures thanks to the use of the larger 1.4 micron pixels coupled with a fast f/1.7 lens. Samsung has also increased the battery capacity over last year’s flagship. The S7 has a much larger 3,000 mAh battery for the Galaxy S7 (compared to 2,550 mAh in the S6) and an event bigger 3,600 mAh battery for the Galaxy S7 edge (compared to just 2,600 mah in the S6 edge). In addition, you get fast-charging support not only for wired charging but for wireless charging as well. Ah, the one fans lamented about when they found out the Galaxy S6/S6 edge didn’t come with it. Well, it’s back and I’m sure many of you Samsung fans are already rejoicing. But, before you bust out the confetti, the supported slot that lets you put up to a 200GB microSD card in, is shared. Yup, it’s a hybrid SIM slot which means you will have to choose between either a single SIM plus microSD setup, or a dual SIM without microSD setup. Dang it! Hey, at least you have the choice? Weather hazards are a nightmare that we simply can’t avoid sometimes. Just the other day, I got caught in one of the heaviest rainstorms I’ve ever experienced in Sunway Pyramid and it didn’t matter how big my umbrella was, I was completely drenched which obviously had me worried about my smartphone. But, if you pick up the Galaxy S7/S7 edge you won’t have to worry about such trivial matters like rain damaging your smartphone because it has a water-resistant rating of IP68. Although that doesn’t mean you can go swimming with it, it will survive the accident drop in the pool and/or rainstorm. What’s more, the open ports have been coated with a special water-repellent coating that does away with the need for inconvenient and ugly flaps that you worry could fall off. Take that Galaxy S5! One of the things I liked the most about many Windows Phone devices was their always-on display, or Glance Screen, as the marketing people would call it. Its a convenient feature that makes available basic notifications and information without the need to wake the phone. It’s great that Samsung has caught up with this as well. Samsung’s always-on display lets you choose one of three different screens to display — your calendar, the time and personalised notifications of your choosing. Pretty nifty when all you can do is glance at the screen. Since its running on the Galaxy S7/S7 edge’s SuperAMOLED panel, only the pixels that are required will be lit so this feature has minimal effect on battery life. Much like the new update that the Galaxy S6 edge received with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the Galaxy S7 edge which comes with Marshmallow out of the box, also has a bunch of new edge improvements. Among which is the increased screen real estate allowing more information to be displayed on the edge screen. This extra screen space lets you do more with the Apps edge, Task edge and People edge — you won’t only have one row of apps, you will have two rows. Plus, you will get access to several Quick tools like a ruler, a compass as well as a flashlight. For more information, you can head on over  . : The Galaxy S7 edge is officially  . Pre-orders will start on 7th March with extra early bird perks."

Pre-orders for both devices will be available from 7 to 11 March but they have yet to confirm if Malaysia will be getting the   bundle promo. The official price for both Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will be revealed on the pre-order day as well. This latest update was confirmed during an interview with Mr. Lee Jui Siang, the VP of Samsung Malaysia.  To recap, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are now released with 5.1″ and 5.5″ displays respectively pushing Quad HD resolution. Similar to the S6, it features both glass and metal construction with added refinement around the corners. Powering the device for Malaysia is likely to be their latest Exynos 8890 Octa-Core unit that’s mated with 4GB of RAM. On-board we are likely to get 32GB of on-board storage and this time, it is expandable with microSD up to 200GB with its hybrid dual-SIM tray design.  For imaging, Samsung is taking it a notch higher with its dual-Pixel 12MP f/1.7 camera that boasts 95% brighter photos than the Galaxy S6. This also allows quicker focus in demanding low light situation. The front remains a 5MP shooter but it also gets a faster f/1.7 aperture lens. Powering the devices are a 3,000mAh battery for the Galaxy S7 and a larger 3,600mAH for the S7 edge."

Are we just jumping the gun and passing our views without knowing the whole picture? That was the case during the Nexus 6P by Huawei with many throwing shade at the Stormtrooper visor. In the end, we warmed up to the idea and design. Will we embrace the same scenario this time? Well, let’s take a look at what the   has to offer. Let’s first start on paper and where else better to start than the screen it has: a 5.3-inch Quad HD (2560 x 1440) display. Handling all its computing is Qualcomm’s crème dela crème Snapdragon 820 processor and it gets some help with plentiful of RAM – 4GB to be exact. There’s only one storage option listed at 32GB of internal memory but that’s when the special Magic slot comes into the picture. The South Korean manufacturer has done away with its plastic removable backs and the G5 is proof that they’re warming up to the metal unibody design language – metal is the new black after all. But when companies go for metal they have to sacrifice some nifty features that had fans of Samsung devices going berserk: a removable battery and microSD card. LG could’ve taken some inspiration from  , they’ve done a much better job here as it looks a lot better. Popping the bottom chin off will allow you to swap out the battery and add some of its LG Friends accessories. They’ve also found a way to keep the microSD slot on board with expandability up to 2TB in theory. Since the pop out is on the chin now the rear has nothing to swap about but the familiar back placed fingerprint sensor is still there, also doubling as a home button. LG did away with their usual volume rockers and power button with only the volume toggles now on the left side. They’ve also decided on a horizontal camera module setup for the main camera(s) that provide a 135-degree wide angle stills. It’s possible thanks to two cameras a main 16-megapixel sensor complete with OIS and 8-megapixel secondary camera. Selfies, on the other hand, is taken care of an 8-megapixel shutter. Powering all this and charging via the port of the future (USB Type-C) is a small-ish 2800mAh lithium ion battery. We’re lucky that the G5 arrives with Quick Charge 3.0 and LG claims it’ll charge from 0% to 80% in only 35 minutes. While, the sole screen on the device has an always on display feature. Despite having the rather small battery, you’ll definitely appreciate that the always on display that only uses 0.8% of battery per hour. On the software front, as we expected it’ll run Android Marshmallow out of the box with LG’s own UI skin laid on top. Sadly the model that they showed off at MWC 2016 was a single-SIM 4G LTE model but we have our fingers crossed that they may be a Dual-SIM variant for other markets. Whenever you buy a smartphone you’re not only buying one device, it’s usually accompanied by accessories that make the experience better. We looked at the awesome add-on modules and peripherals that was called LG Friends  . LG’s latest flagship will come in four colours, Silver, Gold, Titan (Charcoal) and Pink."

Google tried and are still toying around with modular parts through their   program and there’s even a   that lets you do the same. LG believes that we’re still yet to reach “peak smartphone” and whilst moving forward, modules and add-on peripherals are the paths to take. The idea is exciting and being the first to take it on is a big deal but if others follow suit and do better, trouble might loom. Leaks showing this modular removable battery threw us off the chairs at first and it was floating in the far-fetched part of the pool but now that the “ ” system has been realised, our interest levels have peaked."
Cheryl Bates,Here’s everything you need to know about Huawei’s first Windows 10 tablet,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/21/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-huaweis-first-windows-10-tablet/,"huawei,huawei hybrid tablet,huawei mate,Huawei Matebook,huawei matebook hybrid tablet,huawei matebook mwc 2016,huawei matepen,Huawei Tablet,hybrid tablet,mobile world congress 2016,MWC 2016","huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows 10",2016-02-21,"‘s rumoured hybrid laptop is finally here and the  is set to shake the market as the brand’s first ever fully-fledged computing device that runs like a Surface, but is lighter than your iPad Pro. Hybrid tablet devices aren’t something particularly new but the fact that Huawei went ahead to produce the Matebook is what ultimately makes it special; because it represents a shift for the company away from just smartphones into the realm of ultra-mobile devices. Needless to say Huawei has put a lot of thought into building the Matebook, as its pretty sleek at just 6.9mm thick, lightweight at 640g (the iPad Pro weighs in at 713g) and has pretty good build quality. As for the device’s specs, we’re getting a 6th gen Intel Core M processor with the option of 4GB/8GB RAM, with storage options starting from 128GB to 512GB. All of this is supported by a large 4430mAh battery that will apparently give you 10 hours of usage per charge. That’s pretty much your work day right there. The screen on the other hand is a 12 inch IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 2160 x 1440. However, the Core M processor that’s running the show might be the device’s biggest Achilles heel. We’re not fans of the Core M chips and while they do run a lot cooler (and fanless) they trade off performance for the lower temperature and are generally really bad at multitasking. For a lot of devices, the accessories are barely more than afterthoughts, but this isn’t the case with the Matebook. Launching with the device is the MatePen, which surprisingly is a lot better than most pens you’ll find on the market. Not only is it balanced, it feels like you’re writing on paper as opposed to the feeling of writing on glass and has superb feedback and traction, especially since it supports up to 2048 levels of sensitivity. It comes with Autodesk Sketchbook that runs free for three months so you’ve essentially got a really powerful art tool at your disposal as well. Unfortunately the MatePen doesn’t come with the device and neither can it be stored magnetically like the one the  , and has no way to be stored on the Matebook itself at all. The optional dock that the Matebook has available with even has a USB type-C adaptor and a microUSB adaptor that’s all magnetised for easy storage. The device does come with a keyboard case though, and that already is a pretty big plus in our book. Processor aside, the pricing for the Matebook is also a bit of an issue. With a basemodel starting at $699 (that’s about  RM2,941 for us) its quite expensive for a 12 inch tablet hybrid PC with an Intel M processor. Sure, there’s plenty of extras but with pricing like that, they might find it hard to persuade people to jump on their ship. Competition is expected to be pretty stiff considering how late Huawei is coming to the laptop/tablet game. The brand does want us to view the Matebook as a productivity option but it might be a bit tough for it to stand up against the likes of the Surface and other similar devices but it might be able to considering it really has a lot going for it. Stay tuned for more   coverage as it comes. More Huawei Matebook images:"

Well, you would definitely have heard it because malls, stores, and even some restaurants have been playing festive songs all month long. Lively music wasn’t the only thing that came with the Year of the Monkey, red/gold decorations have also adorned every nook and cranny of nearly every building. To commemorate the new year, you will also undoubtedly want to deck yourself out in red coloured gear. But, where do you start? Well, if you’re interested in tech, here’s a list of 8 different gadgets that will surely give you that  glow. [ ]  is a classic. One of the most iconic music players of our generation. Sure their popularity has dropped somewhat with the fact that smartphones can do almost everything, but if you’re taking that into account, every piece of tech has been somewhat affected. The iPod remains an icon though, and if you pick up the touch variant you get access to Apple’s App Store too. What’s more, this red variant of the iPod is under (PRODUCT)RED, where every piece of merchandise sold under this banner will contribute to the global fight against AIDS. [ ] If you want something affordable and red for the new year, look no further than Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi. Their popular 10,000 mAh   also comes in a shade of red that will make anyone blush…if you reflect light off it onto someone’s face. It’s a capable little power bank and that has a wide capacity and a wide compatibility for large range of devices. [ ] Mice are great. Unless they’re of the pest variant, of course. The     is a capable little pointer that is compatible with Windows, Mac, Chrome OS and even Android. It’s a tiny little mouse that can fit in the palm of any hand (unless you’re baby Groot) and as a result is very easy to carry around. Plus it’s wireless and Bluetooth so all you really need is the mouse and your laptop/device. One of our favourite Bluetooth speakers yet. The   solidly built and produces a great sound. Plus, it’s water-resistant so you don’t have to worry about accidental spills damaging your precious soda can speaker. It’s so well built in fact that we reckon you could get away with a spot of bowling with it. We don’t recommend that of course, so do so at your own risk. [ ] Everyone’s (?) favourite   finally arrived in Malaysia recently and it comes in a special red colour to usher in the Lunar New Year. But as with all limited/exclusive devices, it is only available for a limited time, so if you want one of these, be sure to snatch one up before 22 February. Ah a red smartphone! The  is ASUS’s attempt at slapping a laser autofocus system on a budget/midrange smartphone. While it will get you through daily tasks perfectly fine, don’t expect to be blown away by unbelievable value for money. It’s still a solid device though, and that curved red back plate is pretty nice to hold. [ ] Perhaps the other most iconic music player after the iPod is  ’s  . What started out as a simple cassette player that is almost permanently strapped to anyone’s belt in the era before CDs and digital downloads, has eventually graduated to a full-fledged digital audio player. Here’s one that plays Hi-Res Audio looking pretty slick in red. What’s more, they come with a pair of pink in-ear headphones. What’s the point in having so many red connected devices if you can’t get connected? Well, Yes has the solution for you. Yes, the   4G Mobile Hotspot is a nifty little mobile broadband that lets you share your connection with up to 5 devices/users. What’s more, it’s tiny and discreet so you can carry it around with you with ease. It’s also got a long 6-hour battery life which will help keep you connected for longer. What’s more, Yes has an 85% population coverage nationwide, enabling Malaysians to stay connected anytime and anywhere across the country. Plus, if you sign up for their Super 88 Postpaid Plan with Huddle XS bundle that offers you a whopping 11GB of data for only RM88 a month, you can get the Huddle XS MiFi unit for free. Yup, absolutely free. This promotion is only available from now until 31 March 2016 though, so you’d better hurry up if you wanna capitalise on the deal.

Rory Lee,The HTC One A9 has been officially launched in Malaysia.

Disappointing flagships paired with high price tags go a long way in getting people to shy away from them. In an attempt to bounce back, HTC pulled back the covers of their new midrange smartphone, the  . If you didn’t already know, the HTC One A9 is already on sale here in Malaysia via   and   for a whopping RM2,199. That’s a lot to shell out for a mid-range device and there is no denying that this is a device for the middle of the smartphone pack. For starters, it is a 5-inch smartphone with a full HD panel tucked under Corning Gorilla glass. On the inside, it’s powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 617 processor (a notch up over the usual 615/616 mid-range processors) paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable (via microSD) internal storage. Optics are taken care of with a 13-megapixel f/2.0 primary camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS) located in the top center at the back of the smartphone while selfies are taken care of with HTC’s UltraPixel “UltraSelfie” front facing camera. That said, the One A9 has a bunch of goodies too, like a fingerprint scanner hiding under its home button on the front, but HTC’s signature BoomSound speakers are not on the list. The speakers do have a DAC that does Dolby Audio with 24-bit Hi-Res Audio. Keeping the lights on is a 2,150 mAh battery. It is a single-SIM smartphone, though, so if you have multiple numbers, you might have to look for another one. The One A9 then is not off to a good start. That said, here are some of the things we do like about HTC’s new baby. HTC is renown for their ability to build quality smartphones. They basically reinvented the “premium” smartphone with the One M7 back in the day, and this exquisite build finish carries on into the One A9. It comes together fantastically. Its rounded edges are awesome and the metal feels exquisite. What’s more, it’s a handsome looking device, a little too close to the Apple iPhone 6/6S for my taste but if you dig that but want an Android OS, this is the device for you. Speaking of the Android OS, this smartphone comes with the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box, so you don’t have to wait around and hope that it hits your device soon. Marshmallow brings a host of goodies, including the very fun and useful Now on Tap and Doze. Now on Tap is a function where you can simply hold down the home button and allow Google to “read” whatever is on your screen. Then, Google will provide you with the necessary Google Now cards related to specific information on the screen. Doze, on the other hand, puts the smartphone in a state of low power when not in use to conserve battery. Think Apple iPad. According to DxOMark that is. The renown camera testing site tests a whole bunch of smartphone and rates them according to their performance. The higher the number, the better the camera and with a respectable score of 78, the HTC One A9 is the best performing HTC smartphone camera on the list. Are you sold? Do you want to get your hands on the device? Well, in conjunction with the HTC One A9’s official launch, which is going for a recommended retail price of RM2,299, HTC are also having a Chinese New Year promotion. By shopping with HTC, customers can stand a chance to take home gold bars, shopping vouchers and limited edition merchandise. The promotion will last until 29 February and if you’d like to know more you can head on over to their website. Alongside the star of the show, the One A9, HTC are also officially launching the HTC One ME Dual SIM (RM1,599), HTC Desire 728 Dual SIM, HTC Desire 828 Dual SIM, and the HTC Desire 626 Dual SIM."

First and foremost, comes the hostility of getting caught of snapping those photos that’ll probably get you in a lot of trouble. But still companies are finding it harder to prepare for the storm of their devices getting leaked out in the open. Samsung is on top of the ant hill when it concerns their Galaxy S7 duo that’s slated to be released at MWC 2016. LG’s G5 has made a few appearances too but it seems like we’ve forgotten the darling of Taiwan –   with their  . That’s remotely because there’s no more BoomSound (as far as we can tell) and it’s starting to look a lot more Samsung than anything else. It’s like HTC did an 180-degree spin from their design language on the One M7, M8 and M9 and thought that going Samsung-esque was the best decision – way to go HTC, that’s originality for you. In the rumoured specs department, it is claimed that the One M10 will carry a 5.2-inch AMOLED display and feature a top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC. It’s likely that 4GB of RAM will be on this smartphone, along with at least 32GB of internal storage. There’s also the greatly welcomed 12-megapixel rear camera that’s also found on the Nexus 6P. The sensors on the rear and front (unknown megapixel) are also said to be equipped with OIS (optical image stabilisation). Our camera comparison showing what it’s capable of can be found  . To round off, apparently HTC will make use of the home button and let it double as a fingerprint sensor, as they’ve done before. The flagship will also run a Sense 8.0 skin over Android Marshmallow out of the box. We’ve said it time and time again, HTC has made phones with great builds and designs. This time (if the image holds true) they’ve dropped the ball again. Adding to the shambles is the fact that they’ve done away with BoomSound, something that always kept them ahead in the multimedia consumption side of smartphones. Say it ain’t so, HTC. Say it ain’t so. Do drop us your thoughts on the alleged HTC One M10, will it sell like hotcakes? Or will it be another dud."

They’re trying their best, but you know that in the end, that ship is going down, so it’s funny when you see them finally realise that using a teacup to save a sinking ship was probably a big mistake. Or is that just me? Watching sinking smartphone giants throw a Hail Mary to keep their company from plummeting, but also making one monumental mistake, can be quite amusing too. Just take   and the   as an example. You can argue that it is a brilliant smartphone and that the specs are fabulous, but what you simply can’t justify is that exorbitant price tag — which in this metaphor represents the teacup. Unfortunately, on the surface, for a company that has made several smartphones I quite liked,   seems to be making the same mistake with their   — you just can’t justify that price tag. That’s what I thought going into the launch event anyway. I got to spend some time with the little One that could, and while my time with the device was incredibly limited, it did leave an impression. Let’s start with the build. I sound like a broken record but ever since the first One, HTC have proven that they’re capable of making some truly fantastic smartphone builds. They just know how to do premium metal devices. This One is no exception. The One A9 is awesomely built and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that based purely on feel alone, it will easily give you a premium feel. It’s pretty thin too, which should help it slide in and out of your pocket with minimal effort. Both a good and bad thing. The buttons are excellent and clicky which is great, and I like the fact that the power button has a different texture from the volume rockers letting you differentiate them easily without looking. If you can get over the fact that it looks incredibly similar to an iPhone, the One A9 is even quite handsome. Of course, if you’re into an iPhone clone in terms of looks, you will obviously like the One A9. It even has that same camera hump! Make no mistake, this isn’t a flagship device, despite its look and feel, the One A9 is still a mid-range smartphone at best. On the front, it’s got a 5-inch full HD display, which can get quite bright. Inside, it’s powered by a Snapdragon 617 processor (slightly upscaled from the usual SD 615/616 mid-range processors) paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. On the demo unit, performance was snappy. It had no problems switching between tasks and HTC’s Sense UI was pretty easy on the eyes. While I’m not sure how this device would perform under a heavy load, had I not known that this device was running a mid-range processor, I might have been fooled into thinking that it had flagship level specs. That said, my time with the device was incredibly limited so I won’t pass judgement on it until we get a full review. In fact, my time was so limited that I didn’t have time to play with the 13-megapixel camera, so unfortunately, I won’t be touching on that in this first impressions. Or the front facing touch-sensitive fingerprint sensor cum home button. Need I say more? One of the most painful exclusions of any HTC smartphone is always their brilliant BoomSound front-facing speakers. They’re fantastic to listen to, often outperforming even other front-facing speakers. Instead, on the One A9, we get a downward facing  / -esque speaker. I guess if you’re going to look like an iPhone 6/6S, might as well go all out right? It does come with a DAC that does Dolby Audio with 24-bit Hi-Res Audio though. There’s no denying that HTC’s ship is sinking hard and sinking fast. People are even assigning situation-appropriate descriptions to replace HTC’s acronym. They need a saviour and unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like the One A9 is going to be it. With a recommended retail price of RM2,299, HTC are falling into the same trap BlackBerry fell into — thinking that their brand alone will be enough to push sales. We know you want to return to your glory days as soon as possible and the easiest way to do so is to overcharge for a smartphone. But, you’re no  , which means there won’t nearly be enough people who will blindly buy your product just to have your brand stamped on the back of it. The HTC One A9 then is a teacup, and a teacup — as we’ve established earlier — won’t be enough to save the sinking Taiwanese company. That said, I won’t say for certain that the One A9 isn’t worth your money (though it certainly seems that way) as I want to wait for a full review before deciding, but as of right now, HTC looks to be in dire straits."

The leaked document had been sent to the folks at   who’ve by journalistic virtue have chosen to leave their source anonymous but it’s quoted that businesses will soon be allowed to send ads to users who’ve previously initiated a chat with them via the Messenger app. So in the past when you’ve dropped a private message to brand or service provider complaining about an issue – it’ll haunt you. Remember folks, complaining in public always works better. It seems that the authenticity of the document has some worthy back-up as well as a URL short link that was mentioned seemed to have been quietly launched. Facebook also decided to own up to the existence of the URL short link system, allowing us to believe that this whole Messenger ad thing is the real deal. For limitations and boundaries sake, we’re lucky that Facebook isn’t just going to let any business send you spam-my messages. As mentioned earlier, it’ll only be limited to those who’ve started conversations with the brands themselves. This will be great for businesses, though, as people already engaged with them can receive further updates about products or services. TechCrunch points out that this is a big switch from Mr Zuckerberg’s stance on the subject in 2014 after acquiring WhatsApp. He’s quoted as saying “I don’t personally think ads are the right way to monetise messaging”. From pages, messaging options for businesses and even its 2015 initiative “Businesses On Messenger”, Facebook has gradually increased its efforts to be more helpful to the organisations and brands out there.

The largest smartphone in the Chinese manufacturer’s repertoire already has us getting goosebumps because it boasts one of the first current-gen chipsets of 2016 – all eight cores of HiSilicon Kirin goodness. In terms of specifications, Huawei has always been on the up and up and we’re not disappointed with its spec sheet. First in line is the 6-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS-NEO panel that’s protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The majority might argue that having a screen that big should warrant a Quad HD display (2560 x 1440) but for the most part, the Mate 8’s 368ppi will suffice. On the processing side of things, you’re getting an all-star in the form of the Octa-core Kirin 950 chipset that’s clocked to 2.3GHz and accompanied by the Mali-T880 MP4 GPU. For RAM, it’ll come in two options 3GB and 4GB while internal storage will also vary – 32GB and 64GB. The determining factor will be the colour option you choose as they’ll represent different RAM and internal storage capacities. They will come in Champagne Gold, Space Grey, Mocha Brown and Moonlight Silver. Moving to its camera, there’s a 16-megapixel rear shutter complete with OIS, and phase detection autofocus while the front will don an 8-megapixel sensor. There isn’t much to say about the camera yet as we’ve yet to test it but we’re hoping that it’ll perform similarly to the other device made by them: Nexus 6P – you can check out some camera samples  . Taking a look at its rear, you’ll again find a super-quick Huawei fingerprint sensor sitting just under the rear camera module. Biometric security is something that the Chinese manufacturer has locked down to almost perfection. Powering all this is the fairly large 4,000mAh non-removable battery that’s encased in a metal unibody. Although it is still smaller than what was on its predecessor, we’re expecting its battery life to be a lot better thanks to Android Marshmallow and a more efficient processor. Possibly lasting even two days. Despite being a phablet by definition, the smartphone weighs only 185grams which is pretty light in our books. Out of the box, you’ll get Emotion UI or 4.0 that’s overlaid on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow – the skin that always leaves you without an app drawer like other Chinese-based user interfaces. The Mate 8 supports Dual-SIM 4G LTE, NFC and has a micro SD slot as well for additional storage. Unfortunately, there’s no talk yet about how much the Mate 8 go for. Though, in the scenario that our currency exchange rates don’t fluctuate any further, it might be competitively priced against the Galaxy Note5."

Twitter added two-factor authentication since 2013 and Instagram has just decided to do the same. Yeah, it might be a little annoying to get into your account if you’re signing in from a new device but, at least, no random psychopath is going to have access to your precious Instagram account. TechCrunch got in touch with an Instagram rep, confirming that they’ll begin to roll-out this added security layer. Verification will come via text message on your smartphones so bear in mind that a valid phone number is necessary. The typical routine will include an authentication code that is sent to your phone every time someone tries to access your account. Making it a little harder for hackers and stalkers to get inside your account as it’s more than just your email and password. Since Facebook snapped up the online photo/video-sharing app, it seemed like a good idea to further enhance its login system but it’s taken quite a while to finally arrive.

Well, if these recent rendered images hold any credibility, it looks like the rumours are true. From the rendered images, it the most eye-catching feature is obviously the dual camera with the centre flash module and what could be a laser-autofocus unit located right at the top of the smartphone — all of which is housed within a visor that is more obvious on the black, pink and gold models than the silver one. Also present on the back is  ‘s fingerprint sensor, which should be pretty snappy, located just below the camera module. The renders make it seem that the upcoming smartphone’s metal back plate has an interesting brushed texture to it, but that could also be due to poor image quality. One interesting thing to note is that Huawei seems to be doing away with the  ‘s  -esque square design, opting instead for a softer edged curve. Very  / -y in fact. Around the front of the device, there aren’t that many significant features besides what looks like a front-facing LED flash. These images come courtesy of a popular  , and when asked if these images were accurately representing the actual device, someone who has seen the device affirms it. However, a person with knowledge of the design notes that while the images were representative of the flagship device overall, its aspect ratio is slightly off. The source says that the actual device is slimmer and taller than the squat render seems to suggest. Spec-wise, the P9 is said to feature a homegrown Kirin 955 processor paired with 4GB of RAM powering a 5.2-inch full-HD display. Keeping the lights on is an average sized 2,900 mAh battery. It is worth noting that based on our previous report, the rumours say that this device will not be launched during the Mobile World Congress 2016 in Barcelona.

Adding some tongue and cheek to the whole situation is the way the spec sheet was photographed – looking more like a side dish to the rice grains in the photo. Xiaomi’s Mi 5 internal listing is pretty much all bare, aside from some exceptions. Xiaomi’s 2016 flagship smartphone is supposed to have the following specifications: Other than what’s listed on the paper, people have claimed that it’ll have 3GB or 4GB of RAM and 32GB or 64GB of internal storage.

But, before that, electronics giants   and   will launch their latest flagship smartphones a day before the chaos of MWC begins, which sets up a pretty fascinating clash of titans. If either wants to come out ahead, they’ll have to pull out all the stops to draw the crowd — something Samsung is already on top of for their  / …and they’re using a llama. Ayy, llama-o. To try and edge their South Korean rivals, Samsung has launched an interesting ad campaign called the Seven Days of Unboxing, where, as the name suggests, there will be someone unboxing the new flagship device every single day for a week. On the first day, Samsung allowed Tyson — a five-year-old — into an unmarked black box, where the phone is, located in what looks like an empty warehouse. Tyson then had 30 seconds to unbox the device and take a good look at it before he was asked to draw what he saw. The resulting image looks like a bunch of flowers trapped in a box (if you can derive some meaning from this, do let us know in the comments below) which doesn’t give much of the device away. The second day though. Samsung sent a llama — yes, an actual living and breathing llama, not a guy in a llama suit — into the same unmarked black box where it had 30 seconds to “unbox” the S7/S7 edge before it had to paint what it saw. Clearly, without opposable thumbs, the llama isn’t going to be much of a painter, but using its sizable mouth, the animal left the canvas with several swaths of colours — gold, black, blue and silver — which hints at the potential colours available for the S7/S7 edge. Samsung’s new smartphones have been said to come pre-loaded with a bunch of   like waterproofing, a microSD slot and an all new camera technology. The only unfortunate thing is that these devices don’t look particularly special as past renders and leaks have been indicating a nearly identical look and build to that of the  / .

Mainly that’s due to the Japanese company having great technology but bad implementation – awkwardly seen on their flailing flagship smartphones. The just announced sensor has Sony boasting about its 22.5-megapixel lens that comes feature-packed with an on-chip processor for auto-focus and image stabilisation. That isn’t all, as the Sony Exmor RS CMOS sensor will also be 1/0.2-inches smaller than its predecessor, now listed at 1/2.6-inches. It’ll also have a 1.0µm pixel size but Sony claims there’s nothing to worry about because they’ve used a special manufacturing technology that allows them to tweak light utilisation efficiency and improved the design of the circuit to maximise noise elimination. We’ll have to see how well this works in practice but knowing Sony, we’re not sure what to think just yet. In short, using a smaller sensor means that the pixel size will “suffer” to compensate for the form factor. Other add-ons also include a 3-axis video stabilisation that we talked about earlier but since it’s internal, there won’t be a need for accompanying modules like you see on the LG G4; that uses a Sony camera. We’re very familiar with Sony’s SteadyShot feature and we don’t expect them to mess up their image stabilisation feature though they’ve peaked our interest to see how much better they can improve it. Rumours indicate that Samsung will employ Sony for their upcoming flagships as they’ve done in the past and you can bet that other manufacturers are thinking of putting Sony’s IMX318 sensor on their upcoming devices. Repeated many times over, the equipment helps only so much as processing plays a big part too. Will Sony work on their image processing? Fingers crossed.

In light of the 1970s hitting Cupertino’s darling in timely fashion, it looks like   hackers have been busy too. This time, it does a lot more damage than its Unix-based brethren. Like wiping all data on your smartphone and spreading the exploit further through random calls and texts. The malware known as “Mazar” was first discovered by Heimdal, a security firm based out of Denmark. Mazar begins its infiltration by sending a multimedia-based link in the form of a text message to unwitting users. Upon clicking the link, users will notice that their devices will begin downloading “Tor”, which then will allow Mazar to hide within the source code. You won’t have to worry if you’ve been sent the message and didn’t bother clicking on it, nothing will happen. Heimdal has only tested devices running on Android KitKat (4.4) but notes that the flaw could probably be on past versions. At the same time, it’ll be hard to know if newer versions also have this security hole as no testing was conducted on Lollipop and Marshmallow devices. Firstly, there’s one single line of defence by default on Android smartphones. That’s the ominous “Unknown sources” toggle in your security settings; an option that allows you to allow installations for apps of unknown origins. Believe us, the first thing we did was uncheck that bugger. Russians or Russian-speaking folks will also have another added wall since it apparently doesn’t affect devices with Russian as the default language. Lucky Russian speaking people."
Rory Lee,Moto 360 2nd Generation: Second time’s the charm?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/20/moto-360-2nd-generation-moto-360-sport-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"hands on and first impressions,Lenovo,Malaysia,Moto 360,Moto 360 2nd gen,Moto 360 2nd gen Malaysia hands on,Moto 360 Sport,Motorola","Android,Lenovo,Mobile OS,Motorola,Smart Watch",2016-02-20,"I remember my Uber driver asking me what I thought was the next big tech trend. My answer was simple: Modular devices. It seemed obvious to me because in a world of smartphone carbon copies, who doesn’t want to stand out? Imparting personality and specified functions to devices seemed like the best way forward. He was clearly not expecting this answer and it only was after a few moments of awkward silence that he revealed what he was actually thinking of: Smartwatches. Ohhhhh. It never occurred to me that smartwatches are the “next big tech trend” because not only am I exposed to people wearing smartwatches all the time, nearly everyone in the office also has some kind of smartwatch. It’s almost as common as smartphones, so at most — to me, anyway — smartwatches are the tech trend of today. But, if you consider the general public, this is still a novelty/upcoming piece of tech. You don’t really see smartwatches that often so it would make sense that it is still considered a tech trend of tomorrow. When the smartwatch, as we know it today, first started out, many manufacturers and designers were uncertain about what it should look like. Many opted to put an ugly square on your wrist, which if you think about it, sort of makes sense because a smartwatch was essentially a smaller smartphone that fits on your wrist. I think they were, for the most part, wrong as people don’t want to wear smartphones on their wrist because that’s where watches go. One of the companies that got this formula right was   (now just Moto) with the first  . It simply had a cool factor about it and I’m happy to say that the sequel keeps to this trend. If you’re looking for a classy watch, you can’t really go wrong with the standard Moto 360. It is a thing of beauty. The 316L stainless steel case, which comes in either 42mm or 46mm sizes, is well built and feels really nice in the hand. Unlike some smartwatches, the Moto 360 sits on your wrist like it belongs there, rather than looking like a sore protrusion. It is worth noting that if you pick up the 42mm Women’s edition (which goes for RM1,499) it comes with a tiny 16mm strap and that makes the watch look downright comical. It’s like tying the head of a lollipop to your wrist with a wet noodle. You’re better off with the 20mm strap, but you won’t get Rose Gold because that’s only for the Women’s version. Quite the pickle eh? Much like the original Moto 360, the 2nd Generation watch runs on Android Wear. While Android Wear isn’t where we’d like it to be right now, it has come a long way and is slowly maturing into a well-rounded watch operating system. It’s got a whole bunch of nifty features like Google Now, alarms, calendar reminders, as well as the regular notification pushing. It also lets you reply to WhatsApp messages via speech-to-text. The Sport is the Moto 360 for the fitness enthusiast. Unlike its elegant regular brother, the Sport does not have a sexy stainless steel body. Not one you can feel anyway, as most of the case is covered in the same rubberised material that makes up the smartwatch band. Yup, that means the entire strap piece is proprietary and what I guess you could call a uni-bodied strap. As a result, if your strap cracks or breaks, you’re going to be in some amount of trouble trying to get it fixed. A big thumbs-down there then. While the classic smartwatch comes in two sizes, the Sport only comes in a 45mm case, and while that looks fine on my hairy wrists, it may seem a little bulky on more delicate wrist sizes. The biggest difference — besides the rubber strap — is the fact that it has a new “AnyLight” hybrid display that, in short, improves sunlight visibility. Does it work? Well, the short answer is yes, it does let you view it even under direct sunlight. One other thing that might turn fitness nuts onto this device is the fact that it has GPS connectivity. It’s constructed in true Moto 360 fashion, with a premium build and feel though there are a few annoying niggles. One of which is the fact that the rubber strap picks up all manner of dust. Anything that is small and speck-like just finds its way onto the strap and in your desperate (but futile) effort to get it off, more dust will settle on other parts of the strap. That’s a nightmare. Another is that little cutout for the microphone at the side of the watch. It feels so half-arsed, like they wrapped the device up in that hideous rubber condom before realising “Oops we forgot to make a hole for the mic. Let’s just cut one out”. That aside, the rest of the watch is a class act. Both the Sport and the regular versions of the Moto 360 are fantastic smartwatches to have on your wrist. They just feel right, and that isn’t always easy to find in a smartwatch. Functionality remains to be seen, but with the time I’ve spent on Android Wear, it is quite fun though not entirely practical, though that’s not the Moto 360’s fault. But, that’s a story for another time. In all honesty, I can’t say that this — with   at RM1,399 — is the best smartwatch money can buy. I can’t even say that this is the best round smartwatch money can buy because it technically isn’t even round with that dastardly flat tire that many seem to hate. But, to me, that gives the watch character and for something that you’re going to wear every single day, you’d want it to have character. Let me put it this way: In a world of generic square smartwatches trying to look smart and round smartwatches trying to look like regular watches, what’s the easiest way for someone to tell that you have a Moto 360?"
Rory Lee,Moto 360 2nd generation officially lands in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/18/moto-360-2nd-generation-officially-lands-in-malaysia/,"Android Wear,launch,Lenovo,Mid Valley,Moto 360,Moto 360 2nd gen,Moto 360 2nd gen Malaysia official launch,Moto 360 Sport,Smart Watch,SmartWatch","Android,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Motorola,Promotions,Smart Watch",2016-02-18,"The big daddy of the round smartwatch was always the original  , with its sexy round looks and edge-to-edge thin bezel display. It looked classy and simply reminded smartwatch makers that the smartwatch doesn’t need to have a massively redesigned look — classic good looks worked just fine, if not better. While the second generation Moto 360 fixed many of the problems that existed with the original smartwatch, there just didn’t seem to be enough to set it apart from its other   rivals. Matters are made worse in Malaysia as the biggest selling point of the Moto 360 — Moto Maker — isn’t even available here. However, if you’re like me, and have coveted this watch since you first laid eyes on it, good news! It finally got its official release here in Malaysia. I can’t really put into words why I like this watch. Maybe it’s how every little detail of it’s build is just slightly more refined than its competition. Take the   for example, it’s a thing of premium beauty that just oozes elegance, but if you ask me, I think the Moto 360 is just a little more refined and put together just a little better than the Huawei Watch. And when it comes to a premium build and feel, we all know the little details matter. But, I know many of you will be disappointed by the fact that the flat tyre is still here, despite the fact that other round smartwatches have done away with it. I was a little annoyed by it at first, but at the risk of sounding like a terrible cliche, there is no exquisite beauty without some strangeness in the proportion. There are other things to like about the Moto 360 too, like Android Wear. It has come a long way since its inception, bringing it closer than ever to being a well rounded smartwatch OS. However, it would be nice to have a more user-friendly UI so you won’t have to spend an hour or two just trying to work out how to navigate the interface. Plus, just because it doesn’t stand out too much in terms of performance and functionality compared to its rivals, it doesn’t mean that the watch isn’t a good performer. It is still a pretty solid all-rounder. What’s more, if you get the standard version, you have a near endless choice of straps as they use standard 20mm, 22mm and 16mm straps. If you’re a fitness junkie, they’ve even got a Moto 360 Sport variant which comes with a new ‘AnyLight’ display that improves visibility under bright light, plus GPS connectivity. However, this variant comes with a proprietary, non-swappable rubber strap which means that if you tear the strap, you’re going to be in a pretty bad spot. Here’s a recap of the specs. The standard Moto 360 retains the same round look with a durable 316L stainless steel case. The 46mm version gets a 1.56″ 360×300 display, while the smaller 42mm unit gets a 1.37″ 360×325 display. It supports both Android and iOS smartphones and it connects via Bluetooth and WiFi. There’s also a heart rate sensor and IP67 dust and water resistance. I can’t say this is the best Android Wear smartwatch money can buy because it certainly doesn’t blow people away with a kick ass spec sheet, but I can tell you that if I were to get an Android Wear watch, this would be it. It just looks and feels   on the wrist. It’s a smartwatch you buy with the strongest muscle in your chest, not that bowl of grey noodles sitting in our heads. If you are interested, the Moto 360’s pricing is as follows: All the smartwatches will be on sale at SenQ, Urban Republic and Thunder Match stores nationwide, as well as online at  . As a little icing on the cake, if you pick up the Moto 360 at the roadshow, you will be getting a 10% discount on all models on sale. If you purchase two smartwatches, that discount goes up to 20%. There is also a special deal for the first 100 customers, the details of which can be found  . The roadshow is being held at Mid Valley and will run until this Sunday, 21st February."

This is yet a budget smartphone that’s a notch higher than its current entry-level  . Based on earlier speculation, this might be the   smartphone for the year.  While being an affordable device, the Lumia 650 could be the better built smartphone from Microsoft in a while. Instead of a plasticky body that wraps around its current Lumia 950/950XL flagships, the Lumia 650 features a highly polished, diamond cut and anodized aluminum frame for a premium feel. On top of that, it is currently the thinnest Windows 10 smartphone at only 6.9mm, the same thickness as an iPhone 6. At the front, it gets a modest 5″ AMOLED display that pushes HD 720p resolution and it is toughen with Gorilla Glass 3. Under the hood, it gets a Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 Quad-Core processor that’s clocked at 1.3GHz. There’s also 1GB of RAM and 16GB of on-board storage that’s also expandable up to 200GB extra via microSD. For taking pictures, it gets a more decent 8MP f/2.2 main camera with LED flash, while the front gets a wide-angle 5MP shooter. Despite being a step above the Lumia 550, the battery on the Lumia 650 is slightly smaller at 2,000mAh. For this price range and processor, don’t expect this to support Continuum and it still charges up with a traditional microUSB cable.  
The Lumia 650 supports 4G LTE and it is also available in a dual-SIM variant. Available in either matte black or matte white, it will be first available in Europe starting on 18th February at US$199 (about RM822). As comparison, the Lumia 550 is   at RM559 in Malaysia.

The grapevines surrounding Huawei’s HQ has long gone about a rumoured hybrid laptop that’s has been in the works. This particular device is dubbed simply as the Matebook. A term that was supposedly trademarked by Huawei themselves awhile back. Given the fact, it doesn’t take a genius to implore the notion that Huawei might be making a fully-fledged computing device. It seems too soon for Huawei to out another phablet as the Mate 8 has just been announced late last year so our money is on this alleged detachable tablet to make its grand appearance at the mobile-focused exhibition show.

Rory Lee,There is nothing we don’t know about the Samsung Galaxy S7 now,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/17/there-is-nothing-we-dont-know-about-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-now/,"Android Authority,Galaxy S7,hands-on video,leak,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,samsung leak","Mobile Devices,Rumour Mill",2016-02-17,"Oh dear, the   hasn’t even been unveiled yet and we already have a hands-on video. I guess some secrets simply won’t stay secret as Android Authority’s “ ” has given the some spec details as well as a couple of images plus a 14-second video of the upcoming   flagship. According to Android Authority, their source claims that the Galaxy S7 is indeed water resistant (IP68/IP67 rating) — as we found out earlier — and it will come preloaded with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Besides that, the device’s lights will be kept on courtesy of a 2,800 mAh battery. For optics, their source claims that the smartphone has a 12-megapixel shooter, though, despite the smaller megapixel size, it does have larger pixels similar to that on the   and 5X — or if you want to stretch the comparison,  ‘s UltraPixel unit. The current Galaxy flagships all have fantastic cameras, so we doubt that this one will be the unit to let it down, even if it uses Samsungs new and untested   technology. In fact, it is even supposed to improve the smartphone’s low-light capabilities. All that is nice and dandy but we think the spec that Samsung fans will be most excited for is the return of the microSD card slot. As shown in the image above, the tray has clear labels that one section is for the SIM card while the other is reserved for a microSD card slot. However, there is no SIM 2 option so it seems very unlikely that the Galaxy S7 will have support for a dual-SIM configuration. That said, despite the claims that the 12MP BRITECELL snapper can vastly reduce the camera hump, it appears that the S7 still has that square protruding unit that is sticking out from all the current Galaxys. That said, we can’t say for sure whether this will protrude as much as the current ones based on the angle of the shot. Finally, what seals the deal that this is very likely a legit Galaxy S7 is the curved  -esque back. We liked the curve as it helped the device fit better in our hand, something that you won’t find on the current Galaxy S6/S6 edge. Other than that, the phone is almost identical to the current  , so much so that from the front they look almost indistinguishable. Software wise, the UI looks very similar to that of the current TouchWiz, though it does look like a lighter skin. The Flipboard is still present on the left side of the screen, though. We didn’t get to take a peek at the notification quick-access, so we can’t tell what that looks like. Keep in mind that this is still not an official video or release so we won’t know exactly how accurate this leak is until the smartphone gets launched on 21st February. Keep it locked to SoyaCincau.com because we will be there covering the event live. What do you guys think of the Galaxy S7? Yay or nay? Let us know in the comments below."

The South Korean electronics giant said that the rollout will begin on 15th February 2016 to the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge with the other Galaxy devices soon to follow suit. Samsung has also said that they will make separate announcements on details of OS updates scheduled for each market accordingly. If we refer to the earlier leaked rollout table, all Marshmallow supported Galaxy devices should receive their update latest by April of this year. That said, the ETA revealed in this table may not be entirely accurate so take it with a pinch of salt. Nevertheless, if we’re sticking to the leaked schedule, we can expect the next Samsung devices to receive the Marshmallow updates to be the   and the   as those are the two remaining devices with an ETA of February 2016. Exactly when this will happen remains unclear. Android 6.0 brings a host of new features to the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge devices, though the edge variant does get the better end of the deal. This is because there are specific improvements coming to the edge screen with this update. Most notable of which is that the panel is no longer limited to the 260-pixel width of the curved part of the display. In fact, it can now be expanded to 550 pixels wide, allowing even more content to be displayed. Now, users can customise up to nine Edge panels including both the People edge and Apps edge. Additionally, most of the Edge panels have also gotten a facelift — the People edge, for example, adds names under contact photos and a useful settings shortcut. Samsung are also introducing the Tasks edge where you can create action shortcuts (like create a contact, add a new note, add an alarm, etc), plus a Quick tools edge which will give you access to stuff like a ruler, flashlight or compass via handy dandy shortcuts. The Edge handle is also customisable, allowing users to control visual features like where it is, the lenght, transparency or get rid of it all together. There is no information on when this update will hit Malaysian Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge devices yet though, so do let us know if you’ve gotten your update already."

Jony Ive’s critics must be having a field day with this news as the brand makes back-to-back “design” mistakes – remember that  ? Anyway, if you dropped your dough on the MacBook, here’s how to get your USB Type-C cable replaced in Malaysia: Check if you’re eligible by looking at your cable to see if they match the affected one below. The ones WITHOUT a serial number after the “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China” are cables that’ll need to be replaced.

Do ensure you bring along your MacBook serial number – preferably with the MacBook and its box in tow – for additional verification of eligibility. To check your serial number, you can do so by checking in OS X by clicking the Apple menu, followed by “About This Mac”. Otherwise, you can physically check on your MacBook underneath the bottom of the laptop and also on the original product packaging. You’ll have until June 8 , 2018 to get your charging cable replaced. Those who have picked up USB Type-C port have felt the pressure with OnePlus being the first one to feel the heat.

What’s more, the keyboard also features full-sized arrow keys as well as access (via a fn button) to fifteen different function keys ranging from calculator shortcuts to media controls. Logitech also claim that the keyboard comes with an “anti-fading” treatment which — according to them — means that you will “never have to worry about losing the letter from your keys”. These peripherals are fairly discreet in their stealthy black attire though the keys don’t look like they have much of a travel distance. Priced at RM99 for a wireless keyboard and mouse combo, we doubt you will find too much to complain about this setup.

While the original Vibe P1 is going for RM1,199 in Malaysia, the Vibe P1 Turbo is priced at Rp 3.999.000 which is about RM1,235 if converted directly. In terms of specs, it is pretty much the same device. The front gets a 5.5″ Full HD and it runs on the same Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor. The only difference is that it comes with 3GB instead of 2GB of RAM, which gives it a slight performance bump. The rest of the device should be similar with an aluminium body, 32GB of on-board storage, a 13MP main camera with PDAF and dual-LED flash, and a front-facing 5MP camera. Oddly, the official   specifies the P1 Turbo to have a higher 16MP camera but a smaller 2GB RAM.  The front of the Vibe P1 Turbo also retains a fingerprint scanner which doubles as a home key and its 5,000mAh capacity battery also support Quick Charge.

The folks at the Taiwanese smartphone brand are working on a new flagship dubbed as the “HTC Perfume” and it is likely to be the One M10 flagship when it launches. Serial leakster @evleaks has gotten a couple of juicy details of what the next HTC flagship might be. According to his source that’s close to the project, the device will get a 5.1″ Quad HD AMOLED display and it will run with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 820 processor. He is also told that it will be equipped with 4GB of RAM and a minimum of 32GB of on-board storage. Like all HTC flagships so far, the storage is still expandable via microSD.  HTC isn’t going to kill off its UltraPixel camera feature anytime soon. The main camera at the rear is said to be having a 12MP UltraPixel shooter that’s assisted with Laser AutoFocus while the front gets a 5MP shooter. What’s interesting is that both front and rear cameras are said to be assisted with Optical Image Stabilisation.  Like the One A9, the biggest letdown would be the lack of HTC’s famed Boom Sound stereo speakers. It will also get a fingerprint scanner in front that doubles up as a home button.

Moving down the ladder, they have just announced 3 new processors that boasts better performance and battery life for the entry to mid-range segment.  The Snapdragon 625 is their latest mid-range processor and it uses a 14nm fab process that translates to greater power efficiency. According to Qualcomm, the 625 uses up to 35% less power compared to the Snapdragon 617 that’s currently powering the HTC One A9. It uses an Octa-Core set up with 8x ARM Cortex A53 running beyond 2.0GHz. In the graphics department, it gets an integrated Qualcom Adreno 506 GPU. The Snapdragon 625 chip will support displays up to 1900×1200 at 60fps and it is capable of capturing videos up to 4K. Connectivity wise, it gets X9 modem that does Cat 7 4G LTE (up to 300Mbps), 802.11ac WiFi and it also supports Qualcomm’s latest Quick Charge 3.0. On the current Snapdragon 600 series family, the 625 sits right below the Hexa-Core Snapdragon 650 that powers the current   and its higher end Octa-Core Snapdragon 652.  Next is their entry-level Snapdragon 435/425 offering. The 435 is pretty much an upgraded 430 processor based on 28nm process with 8 ARM Cortex A53 cores running up to 1.4GHz. and it gets an Adreno 505 GPU with support up to a 1080p display at 60fps. It is also capable of supporting cameras up to 21MP and records video up to 1080p. The only difference for the 435 is it supports X8 LTE that brings faster Cat 7 4G LTE speeds (up to 300Mbps) instead of the usual Cat 4 (up to 150Mbps). The Snapdragon 425 can be seen as the replacement of its current popular Snapdragon 410 processor. It still retains the same 4x ARM Cortex A53 cores but it runs on a higher 1.4GHz. While the display is capped at 1280×800 at 60fps, it supports cameras up to 16MP and captures video up to 1080p. WiFi connectivity is faster with 802.11ac MU-MIMO and it also supporters faster eMMC 5.1 storage. For 4G LTE, it uses its X6 LTE modem that claims to have superior battery life than its predecessor.

Alexander Wong,Here’s what to expect from the Samsung Galaxy S7,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/15/heres-what-to-expect-from-the-samsung-galaxy-s7/,"Android,evleaks,MWC 2016,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 Photos,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-15,"In just a week’s time, Samsung will be unveiling its latest flagship, the   at MWC 2016 in Barcelona. Serial leakster   have been dropping lots of leaks on their next big thing and this time we get to see its colour options. Find out what to expect from the big day after the break. 
 
Like a year ago, Samsung will be announcing two models – a Galaxy S7 and a Galaxy S7 edge that comes with a double curved display. To better differentiate the two, the Galaxy S7 edge will be a larger device (likely a 5.5″) while the “flat” Galaxy S7 will retain a more compact 5.1″ display. Both are still pushing Quad HD resolutions with its brilliant AMOLED displays.  
 Based on Evan’s latest leak, the Galaxy S7 edge will come with at least 3 colours – Gold, Black and Silver, while the standard S7 comes in Black and Silver. There are probably more to come since Samsung had introduced 4 colours for the S6/S6 edge, inclusive of one exclusive colour for each respective model.  With the use of metal and glass, expect the Galaxy S7/S7 edge to have the same “liquid metal” appearance. While it looks quite similar to the previous model, the S7/S7 edge should fit better in the hands with its more rounded corners.  
The Exynos 7420 was epic on the previous Galaxy S6/S6 edge and they had even carried it forward onto their latest Galaxy Note5 / S6 edge+ series. For 2016, Samsung will using their newest Exynos processor (Exynos 8890) which will be mated to 4GB of RAM. Samsung is also likely to have Snapdragon 820 powered variants for selected markets. In terms of performance, an earlier leaked photo of a Galaxy S7 edge was   scoring over 130,000 on Antutu, making it one of the fastest smartphones to date.  
When the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note5 were launched, many were disappointed with the lack of expandable storage and the option to go bigger is either costly or non-available (in certain markets including Malaysia). To cater for power users, the   is likely to make a return on the S7 and S7 edge. For a greater peace of mind, the flagship duo might get dust and water resistance as well, which is a feature that’s nice to have. 
The cameras on the Galaxy S6/Note 5 were awesome and it was a point and shoot tool that you can rely on. Instead of a 16MP sensor, Samsung will be downsizing on pixel count for larger pixel size. Similar to the Nexus 6P, the new S7/S7 edge will be rocking a lower 12MP BRITECELL camera that should perform better in low light condition. The   apparently will be reduced significantly, making it flush with its back.  
 Samsung traditionally has been reasonably fast in rolling out its flagship smartphones to its international markets. With the announcement happening end of this month, we could be seeing it on our shores by end-March or early April. Looking at our current ringgit situation, don’t expect it to be any cheaper than its RM2,599 launch price for the Galaxy S6 in Malaysia.  VR seems to be a big deal for Samsung this year and there could be a special Gear VR bundle available on the launch day itself. Word has it that the Netherlands will   as early as next Monday with a free Gear VR headset bundle thrown in. To catch the  , mark your calendars for Monday, 22nd February at 2:00AM.

This   for example. Today, we’ve got another handy piece of accessory for your smartphone that lets you hold your phone with your wrist. It’s called the TUSK, or Telephone Utility Support Kit, and is basically a support hinge that you can attach to your wrist to help hold your smartphone in place, acting as a little hands-free kit…that still requires your hands. Although it looks simple, from the demo video that its creator Derek Rieger put together, the little contraption seems to work like a charm. Not only does it strap your phone to your wrist like an Altair attaches his hidden blades, it also brings your smartphone up to you with a simple flick. What’s more, you can rotate your device on the hinge and even extend the support beam so that it holds your phone out in front of your hand for easy access and use. As demonstrated, Derek shows just some of the ways in which the wrist-mounted smartphone mount can help with daily activities — like holding your phone up as a flashlight when you need both hands to work, plus attaching your device face-up on your wrist so you can look at it like people do in sci-fi games and movies. Fallout 4 anyone? It certainly looks a lot more flexible and functional than the plastic wrist mount that comes with the Pip-Boy edition of the game. That said, there are some preliminary potential problems that the creator should probably address, like the ease of which you can attach and detach a smartphone. According to the  , it looks like you will have to stick your smartphone onto the base for it to be held in place. While he claims that it will not leave any residue on your smartphone, we don’t imagine it will be terribly easy to remove and replace your smartphone on the TUSK considering the strength of the adhesive. That said, this can be easily rectified with perhaps a twist lock plate that could be mounted on the back of your smartphone or a dedicated case. Regardless of its faults, this does seem like a pretty cool idea, but do keep in mind that this is still a crowdfunding project, and we’ve all heard the crowd-funding horror stories. If you’re interested in checking this device out, head on over to its   or Derek’s  . You can also pick one up for yourself by pledging a minimum of USD39 (around RM161).

Yep, you know what devices we’re talking about — the   and the  . Both of these devices are metal-clad premium budget devices that are targetted at those who don’t want to spend a whole lot of dough on a phone, but at the same time don’t want their devices to feel   they didn’t spend a whole lot of dough. Fickle right? But I digress. While the two devices share about as many similarities as a pair of identical twins, there are a few things each device does differently so the biggest question is which one should you get? Well, here’s a short comparison that will hopefully give you a little clue. Both of these devices sport a 5.5-inch full-HD display, which as we know is pretty much as good of a compromise as it gets when it comes to crispiness versus battery-saving. However, these two metallic smartphones do not share the same battery size as the honor 5X gets the shorter end of that stick. While the honor 5X does have a pretty substantial 3,000 mAh battery, it simply can’t compare with the Redmi Note 3’s 4,000 mAh battery. Simple math will tell you who is the winner, so if you’re a power user that doesn’t like to carry around a powerbank, the Redmi Note 3 is the better option."

If you haven’t been too busy with the Lunar New Year, you probably would have noticed that there is a new iPhone exploit going around that people can abuse to brick your iPhone by simply setting the date to 1st January 1970. Yup, you can brick an iPhone by changing its date. Apparently, the discovery of this bug was thanks to YouTuber  , who demonstrates in his video linked above what he thinks is the “fastest” way to brick an iPhone. All you need to do is head into your iPhone’s general settings and switch the date manually to 1st January 1970. It will take a lot of scrolling thanks to Apple’s brilliant manual date setting implementation but you’ll get there eventually. Once that’s done simply restart the device and it will be stuck in a bootloop. While   have suggested that the only way to fix this particular problem is to send your phone in for repairs/a swap,   has a simpler, more DIY solution. What he did was simply unscrew the back plate of the iPhone, lift it up and disconnect the battery powering the device. After a short 30 second wait, simply reconnect the battery and power on your phone. Disconnecting the battery resets the time and date so your iPhone should be good as new. Why does this happen? Well, the explanation is rather simple actually: Midnight on 1st January 1970 marks the start of what is known as the Unix time system — a simple system that programmers use to represent date and time based on how many seconds had elapsed since that January 1st, 1970. Here’s a video by   detailing why this problem happens and how it is related to the Unix time code. In a nutshell, setting the date to 1st January 1970 basically resets the Unix timestamp to zero, and because the phone (or somewhere in the programming code) will do a simple check upon startup (like a battery time calculation), setting the date before January 1st, 1970 (or the Unix epoch) causing an  . Since you can’t store negative numbers in this format, the number in the 64-bit processor wraps around to its maximum value — a date that is 20 times longer than the expected lifespan of the universe. As you can imagine, your little iPhone may run into some problems displaying that date. I can’t even display that date in my head. The result? A crash. It goes without saying that we do not encourage you to try this out on your iPhone and will not be responsible for any bricking of any iPhones. Do so at your own risk. We also do not encourage you to mess with your buddy’s iPhone otherwise, his/her iPhone may not be the only thing breaking. That said, it does seem rather silly that Apple allowed a bug like this to go through though it is worth mentioning that it only affects 64-bit iOS devices that are running iOS 8 and above. In any case, as JerryRigEverything suggests, the next time you want to go time travelling, bring an Android device. But hey, at least there is a fix, right?"

Their new X16 LTE is the first commercially announced modem that’s designed to deliver up to fibre optic 1Gbps speeds over today’s 4G LTE networks. That’s LTE Category 16 speeds, versus the current Cat 9 (600Mbps) and Cat 6 (300Mbps) standards that are supported on current flagship smartphones.  Making 1Gbps possible is the use of multiple antennas and advanced signal processing. Through carrier aggregation, the X16 modem can receive 10 streams of LTE data simultaneously through 4 antennas. With an average throughput of 100Mbps per stream, you can get 1000Mbps download speeds combined.   Since late 2014, Qualcomm is capable of hitting 450Mbps via carrier aggregation (3x 20Hz) with up to 64-QAM on the Snapdragon 808 and 810 chipsets. Now with support for 256-QAM, the X16 modem is able to deliver more than double the speeds from the same amount of spectrum. To maximise its potential, it can also tap into LTE unlicensed spectrum such as 5GHz, that’s being used by 802.11ac WiFi. Before you get excited, the X16 modem isn’t available on their current Snapdragon lineup. Their current top-end Snapdragon 820 uses the X12 modem which goes up to 600Mbps. Even if it is available, the real life capabilities depend on the telcos themselves. Both Digi and Maxis have deployed LTE-A at selected locations but the reality is that we only managed to get slightly above 100Mbps versus its theoretical 300Mbps download speeds.  So is this 5G? Not really considering   by Huawei and NTT Docomo have already hit 3.6Gbps, with an average speed of 1.34Gbps. What can you do with it? How about watching live stream 360 VR videos at 4K resolution. We probably need to wait a year for devices to support them and a couple years extra for our telcos to catch up."

Pictured above is a Galaxy S7 edge (SM-G9350) that apparently scored an impressive 134,704 on Antutu. That’s higher than the   which destroyed every Android flagship smartphone for 2015. Appearance wise, the Galaxy S7 edge looks more rounded and it kinda reminds us of the Pebble-ly shaped  . To recap, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge is expected to come in a 5.1″ and 5.5″ display respectively, both of which are pushing Quad HD display. This time, Samsung is likely to make both devices dust and water-resistant like its former Galaxy S5 and expandable storage via microSD is expected to make a comeback as well. Since the Galaxy S6 was a stellar camera performer, the new Galaxy is expected to improve further with a 12MP shooter that has bigger pixels and larger aperture for better low light images.

While TMgo’s 4G LTE network is capable of going up to 20Mbps, the plan only offers 1Mbps download speeds. Interestingly, the user has   that he managed to get 2Mbps download.

The HTC One A9 is their first smartphone with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box, and it supports 4G LTE on a single SIM. Keeping the lights on is a 2,150mAh battery that’s tiny for a device of this class.

Or is there a clip that you would want to save for faster playback? Here’s some good news. Google has quietly rolled out YouTube offline playback in Malaysia and it is available for both iOS and Android users.  To download a clip, just open up any video on the official YouTube app on your smartphone. If this is your first time, you should see a pop-up showing you the new “Watch Offline” button on the bottom right of the video. Once you’ve tapped that, you have a choice to download in the quality of your choice up to HD 720p resolution. To save on data, we suggest doing this over WiFi and you can set to download only on WiFi under YouTube settings.  To view your offline videos, just head over to your Account Tab (usually on the far right on the YouTube home screen) and click on Saved videos. It doesn’t seem to be a limit on how many videos you can save, so it depends on the amount of free space that’s available on your phone or tablet. According to the  , each video is playable offline up to 48 hours. After that, you would need to reconnect your device to the internet to check for any changes.

Instead of forking money on fancy Oculus or   headset, the next Alcatel OneTouch smartphone will give you a VR experience out of the box, quite literally.  Meet the Alcatel’s new OneTouch Idol 4S. Before we talk about the device, check out its clever packaging. Instead of a recyclable paper box, the Idols 4S is packaged in a hard case that doubles as a VR Headset. No worries about support as the headset is Google Cardboard compliant. It’s a pretty clever use of packaging and we wonder why nobody has thought of this earlier.  In terms of specs, the Idol 4S is a step above Alcatel’s usual low to mid-range offering.

Alexander Wong,"Which telco in Malaysia offers the best value for calls, SMS and data all in?",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/05/malaysia-high-quota-postpaid-plan-comparison-celcom-digi-maxis-umobile/,"Celcom,Celcom FIRST Gold,Celcom First Postpaid,Celcom Postpaid,DiGi,DiGi Postpaid,Digi smartplan 75,Malaysia Postpaid Comparison,Malaysia postpaid plan,Maxis,Maxis postpaid,MaxisONE Plan,Postpaid,postpaid plan,Postpaid Plan Comparison,U Mobile,U Mobile Hero P70 Postpaid,U Mobile Hero Postpaid,U Mobile Postpaid","Celcom,DiGi,Maxis,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-02-05,"Malaysians are really getting spoilt for choice as the major telcos have gotten into a postpaid price war by delivering more data for less. After U Mobile introduced its   that offered 7GB of data and unlimited calls to all networks for RM70/month, the competition is seriously heating up. Digi has thrown the gauntlet by introducing its   that comes with similar offering at RM75/month for a limited time only. Just earlier this week, Celcom has responded by revamping its   plan with 10GB of data for only RM80/month.  So which is the best “Pau ka liau” (do everything) plan in town? Read on to find out.  
On the surface, Celcom offers the best value with 10GB for RM80/month. That’s equivalent to just RM8 per GB, and you also get unlimited free calls and SMS for greater peace of mind. However the only gripe is probably the way they split the data. 5GB is given for all day use and the other 5GB is only for the weekends (split at 1.25GB per weekend).  If you need more data, you can top up RM20 per GB and it is valid according to your billing cycle. Another plus for Celcom is that you can carry forward unused data up to 5GB but this is only from the all-day data bucket. On top of that, they are giving out 5GB of WiFi for free, but that’s only usable if you can find a Celcom WiFi hotspot in the first place.  
For Digi and U Mobile, both are very similar with 7GB of data and unlimited free calls. Unlike Celcom and Maxis, you would need to pay for SMS. For Digi, you can enjoy unlimited SMS but that’s only applicable to 3 numbers on their network.  If you use more than 7GB, you can top up data but both only offers a single short term option. 1GB on Digi costs RM8 and it is only valid for 2 days while U Mobile offers a booster pack of 1.5GB at RM10 that’s valid for 3 days.  
Meanwhile for Maxis, they are the most expensive of the lot offering just 1GB at RM98/month. While they promise a worry-free proposition with unlimited calls and SMS, it is way costly if you compare this with Celcom’s FIRST Gold plan side by side. Even if you plan to add more data, it will cost you a hefty RM30 per GB. What’s more mind boggling is that Maxis is offering 4GB of data for only RM48/month for its Hotlink prepaid users.  Of course, pricing is just one factor to consider. There are other things to take into account such as 4G LTE coverage, quality of calls, customer service, and other value added services that you may use in the future. For Celcom, they are offering unlimited music service via Yonder, while Digi offers unlimited music streaming for 120 days and free iflix for a year.  On U Mobile, you get to enjoy free   between 2AM and 10AM, plus free music streaming for radio and KKBox all day. If you travel a lot, U Mobile is also offering free 50MB data roaming daily for selected countries. As for Maxis, they do offer   with free streaming quota for its MaxisOne Plan but that’s only applicable if you opt for its higher MaxisONE 128 plan and above."
Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S7 still has a camera bump but it should be negligible,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/04/samsung-galaxy-s7-still-has-a-camera-bump-but-it-should-be-negligible/,"Android,Camera Bump,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 camera,Samsung Galaxy S7 Specs,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-04,"When the   and   came out, you can’t miss the protruding camera lens on the back. Fortunately, the cameras performed remarkably well but some would prefer if they could eliminate the bump for better aesthetics.  If you prefer for something more flush, the upcoming   might be close to achieving that according to serial leakster @OnLeaks.  Based on his intel, the Galaxy S7/S7 edge will still get a camera bump but it should be negligible. The current Galaxy S6 bump pops out by 1.7mm, while the new Galaxy S7 is said to be 0.8mm, which is more than 50% reduction. This is made possible with Samsung’s own   camera technology that’s designed for slimmer smartphone design.  The new cameras are said to be lower in pixel count at 12MP but it would be compensated with larger pixels for greater light sensitivity. Camera bumps or not, we are more concerned about its picture quality and we definitely expect more from Samsung after seeing the performance of its current 16MP shooters. When the Galaxy S7   went public, it looks very identical to its current S6 flagship but there are some minor design details that add more refinement. The double curve back design from the Galaxy Note5 is carried forward onto the Galaxy S7, while the section of the glass where it meets the edge is contoured slightly as shown above.  With a larger battery, purported to be a 3,000mAh unit, the Galaxy S7 will be thicker at 7.9mm (Galaxy S6: 6.8mm) but the overall width and height will be smaller thanks to its thinner bezels. So overall, you should be expecting a more compact design that’s smoother to hold in the hand. This kinda reminds us of the Galaxy S III with its Pebble like appearance. In terms of materials, Samsung will continue to use metal and glass for a premium look and feel."

They’re certainly not afraid to try new stuff out. Innovation is key, and this time, I think Maxis knocked it out of the park. They made use of modern video making tools like clever graphics and an attractive colour scheme (plus that popular off-camera-side-profile-shot) to deliver something that is usually meant for boring people in equally boring suits. No offence, but you probably see us as hippies sitting around a bonfire so that description is fair I think. What makes this video unique is that it makes the viewer feel smart. We like it when we can actually understand what a financial report is actually talking about, something that has always eluded me when it is presented in the form of a stack of dead processed trees. But, the key ingredient is that they’re building a personality. A relatable face for the company (notice he wasn’t wearing a fancy suit, only a simple shirt). Think of your favourite YouTubers, you remember them for who they are as people, right? You came for the content but stayed because you liked the individual. Otherwise, why on earth does   get so many views? (No offence Lew, I binge watch your videos all the time)"

Both these variants were designed to be premium alternatives to the existing Gear S2 Classic, and to be honest, they did look pretty good. Spec-wise, it’s exactly the same as the existing Gear S2 Classic with a 1.2″ circular Super AMOLED (360×360) panel that results in a 302ppi pixel density.

So, how much does an 18K Rose Gold or Platinum Gear S2 cost? Well, the cheapest Apple Watch Edition 18K Rose Gold costs RM47,000, so that should give you a rough estimate of how much the Gear S2 Classic would cost right? Nope. The Gear S2 Classic 18K Rose Gold and Platinum costs RM1,899, only RM300 more than the original Gear S2 Classic. Plus if you purchase it during the Chinese New Year and Valentine’s Day festivities, Samsung will throw in two watch bands worth RM398 — brown and grey — for free.

MediaTek has finally come out and dismissed such claims, saying that the rumours are all a pile of horse dung. Okay, maybe not in those exact words, but you get the point. The Chinese SoC manufacturer has insisted on Weibo that the Helio X20 is already in mass production and there have been no instances of chip overheating observed. GSM Arena notes that while this is not too surprising, what is surprising is the way the chip stays cool. Apparently, when the higher end pair of 2.5GHz Cortex-A72 cores gets hot, they shut off, turning the chip into an octa-core Cortex-A53 processor. Basically, that means that for the most part, the fancy deca-core Helio X20 is only running on eight cores. That’s like buying a V10 car but only using all the cylinders some of the time. Actually, it’s worse because the two highest performing cores are the ones that aren’t working. That’s actually more like telling the only two grade-A scholars in your 10-man group assignment to take a break while the other average joes work on the assignment. Okay, maybe that isn’t a fair comparison, but on the surface, it sure looks like it. We’ll have to see how this chip actually pans out in daily usage because that’s the most important aspect.

With Marshmallow, the G4 will get to reap all the benefits of the new version of Android including stuff like Doze and Now on Tap. Doze is definitely a much-needed addition to the G4’s repertoire of features because this device has, at best, had a very mediocre battery life from its 3,000 mAh unit. It is a replaceable battery though so things aren’t too bad if you’ve got one on hand. If you don’t know what Doze does, it basically puts the device into a low power state when it is not being used. Think iPad, and you will sort of get the general idea. In our experience, when we unplugged our Nexus 6P at 100% before heading to bed, once the next morning comes around, the device still has about 98-99% of its battery life left, even with WiFi on. Now on Tap is another great feature which lets you hold down the home key to let the OS scan what’s on your screen and pick out important highlights such as names, dates, and locations among other things.

Rory Lee,VAIO made a really sexy smartphone…that runs Windows,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/04/vaio-made-a-really-sexy-smartphone-that-runs-windows/,"Japan,microsoft,smartphone,VAIO,VAIO phone,VAIO Windows Phone,Windows 10,windows phone","Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows 10,Windows Phone",2016-02-04,"‘s return to the mobile industry has so far been a disaster. Their recent   are abysmal. Plus their latest flagship is  . Yet it seems the folks in Japan haven’t gotten the memo because here’s  ‘s latest smartphone — the Phone Biz — and it runs Windows 10. 
 Here we go, another Windows Phone that will probably be let down by the buggy software. Why should you care about this phone? Well, the design for one is magnificent. If you’re unhappy with the fantastic-in-plastic   series then this VAIO Phone Biz may be the device you’ve been waiting for. It looks   good with that metallic finish and aluminium build.  The rails look really well done too, with the slight rounding just before it touches the screen to help with grip. The front is sleek and clean looking (which you would expect if it is supposed to be a business-centric phone) but I’m a little worried about that massive bottom chin. It’s not like it has a great big speaker at the back/front or anything so why is the bezel so big? Still, that subtle curve at the back is definitely attractive if you can ignore the tiny speaker grille and the two panels at the top and bottom. However, on the inside things aren’t as good. It’s got a 5.5-inch 1080p LCD panel with a Snapdragon 617 processor and 3GB of RAM. For camera optics, you get a 13MP rear shooter with a single LED flash. Decidedly midrange then, though it is worth mentioning that this device supports   — a function that lets you use your phone like a desktop. Here’s the weird part: That power button placement. This is a 5.5-inch device with a massive chin and forehead bezel but the power button looks like it’s located right at the top. Pick up your 5.5-inch phone and try to reach the top without changing your grip on the phone. Any luck? Either way, this sleek metal thing will go for JPY50,000 (around RM 1760), but there is no news on whether it will be available locally. All that’s dandy but why Windows 10? Surely there has to be a better mobile OS. VAIO spun off from Sony when Sony decided to sell off its computer division due to   PC sales. This would be their second phone after the first   of the Panasonic Eluga U2."

Now it looks like we have a leaked photo of one of the backs. What you’re looking at is supposedly the back plate of the glass + metal variant of the but, what’s interesting is that they don’t match up with the renders of the device we revealed earlier. First off, the flash is on the wrong side of the camera module — opposite of that on the Mi Note as well — but the shape is pretty much the same. Secondly, this back panel isn’t curved either as suggested by earlier leaked renders. It does look good though, there’s no doubt about that, especially with that fascinating pattern. Not quite the Redmi 3’s diamond etched but a more polished refined brush. Not sure how it would feel in the hand though. As a recap of the Mi 5’s specs, it is said to run a Snapdragon 820 processor with either 3GB or 4GB of RAM as well as either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. Unfortunately, not all Mi 5s will be made the same as the all-metal variants are said to be the lower specd version. That means, the all-metal devices will feature a full HD 1080p resolution screen whereas the glass and metal ones will pack a QHD 2K display. Sizes for the screen has been said to range from either 5-5.2″. For camera specs, it is said to feature a 16MP/13MP camera combo with a 3,600 mAh battery to give it juice. The Mi 5 is purported to come preloaded with Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Xiaomi’s MIUI 7 running over it. It is also supposed to have a physical home button that houses a fingerprint scanner."

Tons of new phones, tons of new devices and a whole lot of people. But smartphone manufacturers have begun to hijack the crowd that will be going to MWC and have their own launch event just before it. Two tech giants have done exactly that —   and   — but while it was very likely the   would be revealed on 21 February, we never had any confirmation…until now. LG USA has released three teaser images featuring the number 5 plus a caption reading #LGG5, February 21st. #MWC2016″. #Hype? Worth noting that LG USA has since removed the tweet. Was it a blunder or an intentional tease? This means the G5 and Samsung’s dynamic   duo will go head to head on the same day. While we’ve heard a lot of exciting specs about these two devices, we want to know is, which would you get? On paper, these 2016 flagships clearly have not skimmed on power. The LG G5, for example, is said to sport the latest next-gen processor from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 820 — a quad-core chip with their latest Kryo CPU architecture — plus 3GB (  say 4GB) of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Samsung’s latest flagships will allegedly feature similar specs to the LG G5. According to popular leakster @evleaks, the upcoming Samsung devices will feature either a Snapdragon 820 or an Exynos 8890 processor (depending on the region) coupled with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. However, while the S7 and S7 edge are supposed to have a larger 3,000 mAh and 3,600 mAh battery respectively compared to the LG G5’s small 2,800 mAh unit, the LG G5’s battery is removable. Here is where Samsung has the slight edge though as their S7 will likely come in two variants — the 5.1-inch regular version and the 5.5-inch edge version. They will also be Quad HD Super AMOLED displays and we know just how fantastic Samsung’s panels are. Plus, the edge variant will probably have all of Samsung’s nifty edge features to boot. The LG G5, though, allegedly has a smaller 5.3-inch screen (down from the G4’s 5.5-inch panel. Why did LG decide to go with a smaller display? Well its allegedly because they want to make room for a secondary   display (think  ) which can house notifications, updates, quick settings among other things. The good thing about cramming a Quad HD panel on a 5.3-inch screen though is that the dots per inch (dpi) value will be off the charts.   actually. Details on the LG G5’s camera are a little all over the place at the moment. Some say that the device will come with a 21-megapixel Sony sensor while others place a 16-megapixel shooter with a secondary camera on the back of the G5 which will help it achieve a wide 135-degree field of view. Either way, with how good the G4 and V10’s cameras are, we don’t think LG will let us down with the G5. Samsung, on the other hand, has pulled out all the stops, introducing their new BRITECELL camera technology that will not only reduce the size of the camera hump but also improve low light performance. Pair that with a 12-megapixel sensor with an f/1.7 aperture lens and we’ve got what looks like a very capable camera. Both devices will obviously feature a front-facing selfie shooter, with the LG G5’s one suspected to be an 8MP unit while the S7 gets a 5MP snapper. Samsung’s new flagships have a host of extra features that were missing on the Galaxy S6. Waterproofing is supposed to be one of them. A microSD card slot is also supposed to be another, which will undoubtedly put a smile on Sammy’s fans. LG though, seem to have baked something rather interesting into their G5. While rumours of an iris scanner have been floating around, there has been no solid confirmation on whether or not this is true. What does seem to keep popping up is something called the “ ” which is supposed to allow for modular hardware upgrade — some examples include different types of cameras. While there is no word on how this will be implemented exactly, it is something to look out for. However, there is no hard confirmation on whether the smartphone will come with a microSD card slot. While these devices do look fairly good on paper, keep in mind that these are only rumours and nothing has been officially confirmed yet so we’ll have to wait until the 21st of February to see. Still, this is shaping up to be a pretty interesting fight. What do you guys think? Which is the worthier flagship? Let us know in the comments below."

This new FIRST Gold plan is a bump up from the  , offering users 10GB of mobile Internet that is split between 5GB of mobile data and 5GB of weekend data (1.25GB for every weekend) + 5GB of WiFi, compared to the existing plan’s 8GB mobile Internet (4GB mobile data + 4GB weekend data) and 4GB of WiFi. Not only that but the entire plan itself has received a price cut of RM20 working out to a theoretical RM5.33/GB of Internet. An emphasis on the theoretical part though because your Internet quota is split between three different types and even in the most ideal of situations it seems unlikely that you will be able to make full use of it all. Nevertheless, this plan also comes with unlimited calls and SMS to all networks which gives it the slight edge over Digi’s recent   SmartPlan 75 and the   which only offers unlimited calls, but as those two plans are cheaper at RM75 and RM70 respectively, it definitely evens things out. Plus, if you’re counting raw 24/7 data alone, both of the plans offer 7GB mobile data, which is 2GB up from Celcom’s 5GB. But, depending on your weekend data usage, you may use more than 2GB over four weekends which would once again place the plans quite evenly with each other. You will get to bring over any unused quota (up to 5GB) to the next month though, which is a nice touch. What’s more, if you exceed RM225 on your monthly usage, Celcom will give you 1GB of bonus data and 2GB of bonus data if you exceed RM500 per month. This means you’re eligible for up to 3GB of bonus data per month if you spend more than RM500 on your monthly usage.

If a tablet was one of the characters in my sappy rom-com, it’d be the ‘one that got away’. To me, it was a novel idea where you could have your smartphone with you for the serious business stuff while your tablet showed you a good time between working hours — literally, with videos and movies or a good book — but when you actually think about it, the tablet simply isn’t practical. If you take a look at the International Data Corporation’s (IDC) latest report on their preliminary data from the IDC Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker, you’ll find the truth in my words as tablet sales are on a downward trajectory. That’s not to say it’s all doom and gloom though as their report also says that detachable tablet sales have reached an all-time high — lead by the sales of none other than the  . Spearheading the detachable (or convertible/2-in-1) pack to finish at 8.1 million devices sold in Q4 of 2015 is Apple’s biggest iPad, the Pro, raking in just over 2 million units sold — more than Microsoft’s entire   lineup put together. That’s quite surprising if you ask me because we think that the Surface, especially the   is a   that can easily replace your laptop, at least for productivity anyway. On the other hand, if you look at reviews online, the iPad Pro is nothing more than a ginormous   with a flimsy looking rubber keyboard that has the word “Smart” in its name. Uh oh, am I “bashing” Apple again? Oops. I guess I was wrong then if we’re going off sales figures because Microsoft only sold about 1.6 million Surface devices in the same quarter. That’s a gigantic gap especially if you consider how many Surface devices there are on the market versus the lone iPad Pro. Quite a feat then but it’s worth noting that this is only one quarter and we’ll have to see if the iPad Pro can keep this up over the coming quarters. We can definitely see the appeal of a 2-in-1 because it brings the power of the laptop into the form-factor of a tablet. The emphasis is on power though as IDC’s findings reveal that of the Surface devices sold, more of them are of the pricier and more powerful Surface Pro line, as opposed to a more affordable Surface 3. That said, Microsoft wasn’t the biggest loser in the last quarter because that title belongs to Google. According to the IDC, Google’s recent stab at staking a claim in the convertible market was rather lackluster and that it “will require a lot more refinement to achieve any measurable success”. Oh dear. Google better get cracking on that   if they want to carve a slice out of this market. Rounding up the report though is the sad news of the “slate” tablet’s slow demise as the entire tablet sales dropped 10.1%, from 230.1 million to 206.8 million devices. The way we see it, the problem with the slate tablet is that they’re neither here nor there. Unless you’re picking up one of Apple’s iPads (they’re leading the sales by the way at 16.1 million units shipped — 7.1 million more than the second-placed Samsung) which do offer some tablet optimisations, you’re usually stuck with either an unoptimised Android tablet or a buggy Windows tablet. Amazon’s USD50 (around RM210) Fire tablet, which runs on their own Fire OS, did come in at a surprising third place — accounting for 7.9% of the market share, beating out the likes of Lenovo and Huawei. Though IDC does note that Amazon’s success is purely based on the price of its tablet. Trying times for the tablet industry it seems, though, there is some hope in the convertible market, it looks like the slate tablet is slowly dying off."

If intend to do this before 12 months, an advance change fee will apply that ranges between RM300 to RM1,000 depending on phone model. Similar to Maxis, you are required to return your existing device in good condition. For greater peace of mind, they are also offering Device Protection which gives you coverage for damages, theft, and even water damage. For new Celcom customers (or those who have only been Celcom customers for less than a year), if you do opt for the NewPhone plan, you will be required to pay 3 months of your NewPhone’s installment upfront, which will be rebated back to you over the coming months. However, for existing customers who have been with Celcom for over a year, you will not be required to make this upfront payment. Also, if you intend to stop at any time, you have the option to keep the device while paying the balance RRP of your installment or to return the phone completely with a one-off penalty charge. When we checked, returning the Galaxy Note5 will attract a penalty charge of RM900. At the moment, Celcom NewPhone only offers Samsung devices which include the Galaxy J7, Galaxy A8, Galaxy S6 edge, Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+. The Galaxy Note5 can be yours at RM125/month or RM145/month if you take up its device protection coverage. As comparison, Maxis Zerolution offers   at RM123/month (with Zerolution Upgrade) or RM146 that includes Device Protection. The key difference between this and Maxis’ Zerolution is that you can choose any plan you want to pair with your NewPhone. This means if you’re happy with your current postpaid plan, you can just add-on NewPhone even there’s an on-going device bundle contract. So if the   isn’t your cup of tea, you can go for Celcom’s more affordable   that offers 10GB of mobile data, unlimited calls and SMS for RM80/month."

But looks are all they’re offering as under the hood these smartwatches are very much the same as the current   Classic. The Gear S2 Classic in 18K Rose Gold is paired with an Ivory Genuine Leather Band while the Platinum version comes with a Black Genuine Leather Strap. Besides the new variants, Samsung is also expanding its watch strap and watch face collection, partnering with exclusive designers like Colombo, introducing premium watch straps for the Gear S2 as well as new watch faces including Peanuts characters and artworks from Keith Haring, Jean-Michael Basquiat, Jeremyville and Burton Morris. Both are expected to be available globally come February this year, but there is no word on its pricing.  With an 18 Karat case for the Rose Gold edition, though, we don’t expect this smartwatch to come cheap.

This time, we supposedly get a glimpse at how Samsung are addressing one of the biggest weaknesses of their previous   flagship — the battery life. According to popular leakster Eldar Murtazin, the Galaxy S7 can last 17 hours of continuous video playback “with maximum backlight” — which according to Eldra is a record for this class of devices. Video playback consumes quite a lot of battery power — especially at maximum brightness on what should be a Quad HD display. If this is true, 17 hours of continuous video playback at maximum brightness is borderline bonkers. Even tablets can’t last 17 hours of continuous video playback. We are curious how they achieved this feat, if it’s true. If we compare the Galaxy S7’s purported 3,000 mAh battery to its predecessor Galaxy S6 active’s 3,500 mAh battery you can sort of get a scale of how insane this claim seems as the Galaxy S6 active can only manage about 10-11 hours of video playback with  . What’s more, Murtazin revealed that the Galaxy S7’s battery takes 100 minutes to go from 0-100% charged which is a touch longer than the existing Galaxy S flagships, but we doubt that people will mind that if the battery can truly last as long as Murtazin claims it to be. That said, this is just a rumour with no word on the conditions of the test — for example, was this streamed or played offline — so do take it with a pinch of salt. If we add this to the list of purported specs that the Galaxy S7 is said to feature — a Snapdragon 820 SoC (and likely the Exynos 8890 in different regions), 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, a 12-megapixel BRITECELL primary camera and a 5MP wide-angle selfie camera (f/1.7 aperture for both) — plus waterproofing and a microSD card slot, Samsung’s next flagship looks to be a beast. The S7 is also said to come in two variants, the 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 edge. I guess we’ll find out if these specifications are true at the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2016 event in Barcelona."

This time, we get an official announcement of the date — February 21 — exactly one day before MWC. And so the stage is set. Pretty darn sexy box if you ask me. Since now we have confirmation that the Unpacked event will be happening on the 21st, that means Samsung will be going head-to-head with its fellow South Korean manufacturer LG who is also holding an   on the same day. Clash of the titans? While we don’t think LG can even hold a candle to Samsung when it comes to sales, the flagship devices that these two giants can produce are pretty close in performance and capabilities. I mean the LG G4 is a great flagship phone and the V10 is basically a better version of the G4. In any case, it will be an interesting day to say the least as these two giants vie for media attention. It is said that the   (and its variants) will be revealed on that day itself, which we’re inclined to believe. If you’re unable to attend the event in Barcelona itself, Samsung will be holding a live stream of Unpacked on YouTube at their   or their  . The event will begin at 19:00 CET on 21 February which translates to 2 am local time on 22 February. Plus, if we’re looking at the video it looks like there might be a virtual reality stream. 360-degree video hype? To recap, besides a host of internal upgrades, the Galaxy S7 is said to feature a similar design to the Galaxy S6 but with dust and waterproof capabilities as well as a microSD card slot. If you’d like to know more about what we know about the S7, head on over  . Speaking of Samsung’s anticipated next flagship, new renders from serial leakster   have appeared on the web that confirms our suspicions about what the device will look like — which is almost exactly like the previous Galaxy S.

Pop-up ads are just too annoying to not use an ad block program.

This updated browser is being pushed to all Samsung phones with Android Lollipop or newer starting today. It will allow users to install helper apps that block ads from websites they visit, similar to Apple’s Safari browser in iOS 9. The first content blocker available for Samsung’s Internet app is Adblock Fast — which is supposed to be the “world’s fastest ad blocker”. Whether that claim rings true doesn’t matter because it is said that this plugin can decrease the web page load times on Android by 51 percent — makes sense since you don’t have to load the banner/popup ads on a page. Still 51% isn’t a number to scoff at. A quick search on the Google Play Store, there are several browsers with built-in ad block functions but none of them have been able to really get people to jump over from Google Chrome. Let’s see how well this does.

What started out as a promising third player in the mobile OS game was quickly shot down. In a recent   by the IDC, it showed that in the recent quarter, about 400 million smartphones were sold and if you compare that to Microsoft’s earnings report, only 4.5 million of them were Lumia devices. That’s 1.1% of the market share. To contrast,   moved around 85 million devices in that same quarter. Things don’t get much better if you compare all time sales between   +   and Windows, where Microsoft and Nokia only shipped 110 million devices total compared to the 4.5 billion Android and iOS devices sold in the same period. That’s only about 2.4% of the market share. And, if you look at this graph, things look like they’re going from bad to worse. I loved the Windows Phone. I spent two years of my life committed to my little Lumia 625. I loved the way it looks, the cool animations and most of all I loved the unified idea behind this new operating system. Despite all the qualms, despite all the bugs and despite all the problems, I convinced myself that the OS was new and it could only get better. Right? Well, I can’t say that with certainty anymore. When Windows Phone first came out, many jumped for it. Extensive investment went into the platform and developing devices for it.   took a stab with their Venue Pro,   went all-in with a pretty stellar lineup of devices (some were tempting from a looks standpoint) and even manufacturers like   and Samsung had a pretty decent lineup to offer. However, as pointed out by Vlad Savov, these investments proved fruitless. Microsoft wanted to be the leading light in their own OS — understandably — and the apparent favouritism towards   (which they later acquired) was enough to piss the other manufacturers off."

With the  , the South Korean electronics company showed that they could do “premium” incredibly well and I wondered if that aspect would carry over to the Galaxy A lineup, or if it would just be a half-arsed rehash. Well, when I arrived at the launch venue floor, that thought was quickly answered. The one I was waiting to find out about. Was it going to live up to the hype? In short, yeah it did that and more. Like the Galaxy S6, the glass panels of the A series (yes all three of them) came together with the metal frame about as well as glass and metal can possibly come together. The 2.5D contoured edge glass helped with giving the side of the phone a rounded and more natural feel in the hand. Each panel was a massive fingerprint magnet, though — as glass usually is — but at least they’re Corning Gorilla Glass 4, so that should keep scratches at bay. The buttons were fantastically tactile and had a satisfying click, even the home button. The three devices are spec’d accordingly, with the smallest 4.7-inch Galaxy A3 being powered by a 1.5GHz Snapdragon quad-core processor paired with 1.5GHz on RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. It is also powered by a smaller 2,300 mAh battery. On the other hand, the bigger 5.2-inch Galaxy A5 has the same processor as the Galaxy A7 — a 1.6GHz octa-core Snapdragon SoC — with the only difference being that the 5.5-inch Galaxy A7 has 3GB of RAM over the Galaxy A5’s 2GB of RAM. Performance across the board was relatively smooth, the most buttery of which is the Galaxy A7. If you place the Galaxy A3 next to either the Galaxy A5 or Galaxy A7, you will notice a slight delay when it comes to switching between multiple applications. In terms of connectivity, all 3 models support Dual-SIM and you’ll be pleased to know that the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 has a dedicated microSD slot, so you can pop in two SIM cards with no compromises. For a series separated by price and tiers, buyers would be happy to know that Samsung didn’t skimp on the camera optics. Well, not by much anyway. All three devices share the same 13-megapixel rear/5-megapixel front camera combo, except for the fact that the Galaxy A3’s snapper is missing optical image stabilisation. Though, with a large f/1.9 aperture lens I don’t foresee poor low-light performance to take too much of a hit. That said, we will have to put them through a proper camera test before passing judgement. As these are Samsung devices. it isn’t surprising that they come preloaded with some extra features. While some were fairly gimmicky, there are two features that stand out. The first of which is the fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7. It’s supposed to be an improved version over the existing Galaxy S6 and from what we can tell, it’s pretty good. Nowhere near as snappy as a Huawei or Apple sensor, but it’s not bad. Another great feature that we were happy came over to the midrange devices was the double tap home button to quick launch the camera. It works as well as on the other flagship devices. In conclusion, these are really pretty good devices. They’re well built and look really premium but they’re expensive. Very expensive. The Galaxy A3 is priced at RM1,299 while the Galaxy A5 is priced at RM1,599. The top of the range Galaxy A7 is going for RM1,899, which is encroaching flagship price territory. To make the Galaxy A series more enticing, all 3 models will come with an extra 32GB microSD card, giving them a total of 48GB of storage out of the box. If you’re looking for something affordable, I can’t honestly recommend any of these devices. But, they do come in pink (EVEN THE CHROME AROUND THE HOME BUTTON IS PINK), so if that tickles your fancy, then these will be the devices for you."

Hmm, I guess life isn’t too good for LG these days. The vulnerability lies in the  ‘s Google Now-esque application Smart Notice. It comes preloaded on all new LG G3 devices and displays a variety of notifications and suggestions, including recommendations to stay in touch with favourite contacts. What happened was, the app failed to validate the data presented to users, making it possible for attackers to manipulate the data and lace it with a malicious code that can be executed on affected devices. According to the researchers who found out about this vulnerability, the malicious code could be triggered when events like callback reminders or birthday notifications were displayed. An estimated 10 million LG G3s were said to be affected by this vulnerability. The researchers developed several proof-of-concept payloads including one that harvested data from the SD card, another that opens the browser to any remote site and a third that performs a denial-of-service attack that could make the user’s phone go crazy. Regardless, the are many ways this vulnerability can be exploited and that puts a lot of your personal information at risk. We have reached out to LG Malaysia to get a statement from them regarding this issue and whether or not it affects our local G3s. We will update you when we hear back from them."

You can now put that fingerprint sensor on your   Galaxy device to, even more, use than before as the South Korean electronics giant has announced at their Samsung SEA Forum 2016 that Samsung Pay will be coming to the Southeast Asian regions this year. We’ve come to that stage in life where we use our smartphones for almost everything. Work, play, productivity, browsing and even the occasional phone call or text, can all be carried out in the palm of your hand. It’s just so much more convenient that way. Add that to the fact that smartphones now come with added security and encryption services, like the fingerprint, and you have another avenue for smartphone utilisation — paying for stuff at the store. Samsung Pay is one of these wireless, moneyless, wave-to-pay services that lets you use either of the following devices: to store your credit or debit card information and let you pay with your phone at “virtually anywhere you can swipe or tap your card”. Support for Samsung Pay is also available on the Gear S2 smartwatch. To illustrate, here’s a clever advertisement about Samsung Pay: As you can tell from the video, it’s fairly simple to get started on using this service. Simply swipe up on your phone to launch the app, pick the card you want to use, secure with your fingerprint and hover your device over the card reader to pay. Hassle free. Of course, it is likely that when this Service comes to SEA, not all banks or carriers will be supported but it is safe to assume that many of the major ones will be. As Samsung have only just announced this at their SEA Forum, there is little information on when this will actually arrive in Malaysia (or if it will at all), though Samsung has said that Singapore and Australia will be the first countries to get this service. We will keep you updated on any developments later."

That’s all peaches and unicorn farts, but what’s gonna happen to this ad? MyTeksi not seksi anymore? Aw, shucks. Regardless, this rebrand does bring more features to the existing Grab app. In an attempt to unify their services into one platform, Grab is adding three new features to their service. No, not that kind of flash, get your head out of the gutter. What this Flash does is put every kind of vehicle (from a standard taxi to a GrabCar+) on the map. Simply hit it and it will call the nearest vehicle to you regardless of the type of ride — perfect for when you’re in a hurry. Keep in mind that Flash is currently only available in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam whereas roll out in Malaysia is set for 30 January. This service lets you input more than one credit card, or choose to pay with cash or use someone else’s verified credit card to book a ride. Once again, the multiple card function will only roll out to Malaysia in February of this year. What this does is basically keep your business rides and expenses separate from your personal ones.

Being one of the company’s first moves into the budget-premium market, the original Galaxy A series was fairly well received and Samsung hopes to replicate that success with the 2016 versions. Much like the original Galaxy A smartphones, these 2016 models feature a premium metal body that is reminiscent of the electronics giant’s flagship   smartphone. The glass panel on the backs of the devices definitely gives them an air of exceptional build quality. Today, they unveiled three phones — the  ,  , and   — which are differentiated by price. As these phones are not created as equals, the more expensive Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 have a fingerprint sensor embedded bellow the home button, a big feature that is missing on the Galaxy A3. However, they do share several key features. The first, and most notable of which, is that all three devices — even the little Galaxy A3 — sports a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture primary shooter plus a 5-megapixel f/1.9 front-facing selfie camera. What separates them is that the Galaxy A3’s primary camera unit does not have OIS while the bigger two do. All three devices also have support for dual-SIM plus an expandable microSD storage slot. Except for the Galaxy A3, the devices don’t use a hybrid-SIM set up so you can use two SIM cards and a microSD card simultaneously. On the Galaxy A3 you will have to sacrifice one SIM for storage expansion. The king of the hill among the Galaxy A lineup, the Galaxy A7 sports a large 5.5-inch full HD Super AMOLED display on the front of the phone. Inside, it’s powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage (via microSD up to 128GB). Giving this smartphone juice is a large 3,300 mAh battery. What is basically a shrunken version of the larger Galaxy A7, the Galaxy A5 comes in at only 5.2-inches, but sports the same Super AMOLED full HD panel found on the Galaxy A7. It packs a 1.6GHz octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. For battery, the Galaxy A5 gets a respectable 2,900 mAh unit in the back. Finally, we arrive at the runt of the family, the Galaxy A3. It comes with a small 4.7-inch HD Super AMOLED display and a quad-core 1.5GHz processor on the inside. Helping you with running apps is 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Since it’s the smallest device here, Samsung have fitted it with a small 2.300 mAh battery to keep things going. It is worth noting that none of these devices will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Instead, they will default to the older Android 5.1 Lollipop, though we do expect them to receive the Marshmallow update sometime in the future. If you want to get your hands on these three devices, the Galaxy A7 will go for RM1,899 while the Galaxy A5 retails for RM1,599 and the Galaxy A3 will set you back RM1,299 including GST. All of these devices can be purchased at the official Samsung retailers from 28 January onwards. All purchases will be bundled with a 32GB microSD card free of charge. The devices will come in four colours — Black, Gold, White and Pink Gold.   From today until 31 January 2016, there will be a roadshow at Sunway Pyramid’s Blue Concourse for the general public to experience the features that the Galaxy A Series 2016 has to offer. A number of units are up for grabs for lucky winners."

They’re horribly old fashioned and often come in colours that resemble different shades of puke. Plus, except for   Case, most flip cases never did anything particularly  . Sure you might have some practical functions, but none that doesn’t scream “ZOMG WHAT A DWEEB”. Okay, maybe I’m being a little harsh here but the point is, I would never, ever,   use a flip cover case…unless they did this. So with a flip case for your smartphone, you’re often left with a lot of space on the inside of your flip case. Space which can be used to either let your toddler/cousin/nephew/niece enthusiastically doodle on, or perhaps use it as a space for you to stick photos of your loved ones — y’know like the inside of a locker door. However, neither of those are particularly practical, nor do they help you do more with your smartphone in any way. Well, it looks like the boffins at Microsoft Research — Microsoft’s research division (go figure) — seem to have figured out a brilliant way to make use of that space. Enter the   “Type Cover” for your phone. What they’ve done with the flip cover is line the inside of the case with an always-on, low-power display that can display “useful information”. Some examples provided by the concept includes the displaying of travel itineraries, tickets, the calendar while you’re composing an email, and (my personal favourite) a fully qwerty touch keyboard. That sounds fantastic doesn’t it? It is, until you realise that if this “inside screen” is touch sensitive and is attached to the side of your phone, how on earth are you going to type with both hands? Here’s a picture to illustrate my point: So unless you’re typing with your index fingers on the table, or if you tuck the case behind your device, it’s kind of unfeasible. Plus, if you do the latter, you might as well just use the multitasking button to switch between apps. There is promise when it comes to the full QWERTY keyboard though, but even that has it’s problems. Because if the phone/case does not have a kickstand it’ll just end up looking like this really   for a  . Either way, it looks like this is merely a concept and could do with a lot more polishing. The good news is that we might not have to wait for the rumoured “ ” to (hopefully) test this case out because Microsoft Research is supposedly “in deep talks” with the Lumia division to turn these flip covers into real products. What do you guys think? Is one screen enough?"

Yes? Then have you ever been too lazy to get into your car and   all the way to a shop to grab a bite to eat not knowing if the food will even be good thus making the trip not worthwhile? Well, now you might not have to pull your hair out over it because popular food review app Zomato is teaming up with   to help bring you to good food. At least, we hope it’s good food. If you haven’t already heard about Zomato, it’s an app that helps you “discover” new food by providing information such as restaurant reviews and ratings as well as create your “own network of foodies for trusted recommendations”. How this works is: You launch the app and sign in to your account. Then you can scroll through a timeline-esque UI of food reviews and ratings based on your current location. Then, you can hit on whichever restaurant tickles your fancy to find out more information about the establishment. While previously it only gives you directions to the restaurant, now it will give you the option to “Ride there with Uber”. Why is this better than just launching the Uber app and inputting the destination? Well, because it happens with a single touch. Hitting the option would bring up a pickup time plus the estimated price range for the trip — just as you would find on the regular Uber app — without needing to launch a new app. Saves some time I guess? This feature has been available to Zomato users in 30+ cities across 13 countries, namely India, Australia, Canada, The UK, South Africa, Indonesia, New Zealand, The Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Turkey, UAE and the United States. Unfortunately, as of right now, we are still unable to get the option here in Selangor. Curious, we contacted Zomato and they told us that the function would roll out in stages. So far only users in Kuala Lumpur can access this function, with Selangor’s availability on the way soon. While I think this is pretty neat, I’ve actually never tried it before. So do let us know, if you’re a Zomato user, what you think about this little feature. If you aren’t a Zomato user, would you be interested in trying this out?"

You can add a microSD card up to 128GB on its hybrid Dual-SIM slot and powering the device is a huge 4,100mAh battery that supports 5V/2A fast charging. In terms of imaging, it gets a 13MP f/2.0 rear camera and a front-facing 5MP f/2.2 unit for your selfie needs. If Xiaomi sells this officially in our market, we reckon that it should go below RM600.

When you sit down, you whip out your phone. When the food comes, you whip it out to post a picture what you’re eating on social media. When you want to avoid awkward conversations with that family member you’re supposed to be close with but barely remember their name, you have to whip it out. I think you get the gist. It’s a bad habit but most of us are guilty of it. Dinner time should be about the food and the people you’re having it with — especially when it is a family dinner. So, IKEA decided enough was enough and came up with an inventive solution to this particular conundrum: They created a new….table? Who would’ve thought of a smartphone-powered-steamboat-machine-table-thingamabob? I definitely didn’t. It sounds fantastic. While the table was definitely interesting, what’s equally interesting are the subjects’ responses. When they sat down, the usual routine of whipping out the smartphone begins right up until the steamboat pot is placed on the fire. One eagle-eyed observer noticed that the soup wasn’t boiling and after some clarification, hit the button and raised the steamboat platform in a futuristic sci-fi manner. Obviously, everyone started freaking out at how cool that was, but when the waiter told them to take out their phones the subjects thought it was to take pictures of the contraption. When they found out they had to place their devices into the base of the machine to power the steamboat, many were hesitant but eventually gave in to their tummies demands. The result was pretty awesome. Everyone made a whole lot more eye contact and looking at each other’s faces rather than the Zuck’s Facebook. Conversation happened with their mouths as opposed to their thumbs. Smiles were exchanged without the need for round yellow emojis. It was heartwarming, to say the least. We’re big fans of good tech and are always on our devices — for work and for play. But sometimes it’s better to just disconnect from your devices and reconnect with actual people and respond to them without needing a notification tone to prompt you.

Drones that can sail across the surface of the water like boats are also pretty cool. Just the other day we were talking about a whole bunch of  . But what we didn’t include was this drone. This guy, is a helicopter, a boat, AND a submarine. While drones can let you get some sick wedding shots and awesome drag racing footage, they’re also a little creepy. People can use these little things to spy on you, streaming video directly into their creepy little devices. If you thought you could escape them like you escape bees (diving in the water, in case you’ve never been chased by bees before) you’re sorely mistaken. This flying, swimming and diving device called the Loon Copter was developed by the Oakland University’s Embedded Systems Research Laboratory. It uses a barrel like body, attached to an otherwise regular quadcopter, to act as a ballast tank in a submarine. Filling it with water allows it to sink beneath the surface. It fills in a unique way that rotates the quadcopter ninety degrees in the water, so that the propellers bcome like outboard motors, allowing the drone to navigate under water. It can’t really navigate very deep bodies of water, but as this is nowhere near mass production, we can forsee it diving much deeper in the near future. When you want the drone to fly again, simply empty the tank and it will send the Loon Copter to the surface again. While, swimming and flying drones aren’t all that new, what sets this drone apart is the fact that it uses the clever ballast system. According to the project’s lead scientist, the drone can sit on the surface of the water without any energy usage, as well as change and control depth with little power and no propeller use. Currently, you can’t stream video from the Loon Copter to your smartphone — so you need to record it for playback later — but the creators have noted that future versions of this little guy could make use of acoustic modems or repeater buoys to allow for live streaming and control options. Created out of noble aspirations to help with search and rescue operations, this drone could also be misused — like all good things in life. The end result would come from the user, and while we think that it could be a little scary to give people this much flexibilty when it comes to filming spy footage, there is no denying the cool (and potentially useful) factor of this little device. That said, imagine how much easier filming the next Jaws movie will be with the Loon Copter. All you need to do is strap a fin to its side and queue the music. Dum dum, dum dum!"

Our own device (also from the US) has for the past week and, for the longest time, nobody claimed responsibility or could even identify what was wrong with the device. Well, thanks to our knights in shining armour over at Android Authority and Techradar, we now have an answer. After picking up the story about the bootloop issues from LG G4 users, Android Authority gathered what they knew and confronted LG about it. Thankfully, instead of denying any problems the electronics giant admitted that there was a problem with the smartphone’s hardware and said that they would repair the affected devices, though it is unclear if your device needs to still be under warranty for it to be eligible. The problem puts the phone in a boot-up loop where it tries to reset, fails and tries again and again which then proceeds to brick the phone. We thought it was a problem with our device’s battery, but now according to  , it is resulting from “loose contact between components”. Currently, it is unclear if this problem affects all LG G4s or if it is just limited to those units in the US. However, according to Android Authority, the bootloop issue persists and affects all regional and carrier models of the device. LG advises its customers who have bought their devices via a carrier and are experiencing such issues to contact their nearest LG Service Center for repair under full warranty. On the other hand, customers who have purchased their G4 smartphones from non-carrier retailers should contact an LG Service Center “with the understanding that warranty conditions will differ”. We don’t know if this problem affects local Malaysian units, so if you are using a local LG G4, do let us know if you’re experiencing such problems. We’ve contacted LG Malaysia ourselves and we’ll keep you updated on their response. [ ,  ]"

If you aren’t one now though, from today onwards you can sign up or upgrade to the SmartPlan 65 (or any higher plan) and get this very offer as well. But there’s more.

That makes sense if you pick up your phone and try to type on it with one hand. Reaching the Q button was always a stretch, but now it seems a lot more plausible. Other than the one-handed mode, everything else seems to be every similar to the Windows Phone version. You have access to word suggestions, emoji and swipe letters.

A metal build, a nice full HD display and a snappy fingerprint sensor are hard to come by at this end of the market. While honor have not announced when the device will go on sale or how much it would cost, we got to take a quick look at this all-metal midrange device. A premium metal construction is almost a necessity these days. While   that a metal body is all that, smartphone manufacturers and people who want to show off certainly do. Has honor delivered with the 5X? Well, I can tell you that it definitely feels better than the more expensive honor 7. The front of the device is nothing to shout about, but when you move to the sides of the device, you can see where all of honor’s effort went. They talked endlessly about the sandblasting they had to do to keep the device feeling smooth in the hand and they did accomplish that to a certain extent. The sides are nicely chamfered (ala-Nexus 6P) to help with grip and very smooth to the touch. They decided to go with a brushed metal look for the back plate but the moment your fingers touch it, the panel feels in no way shape or form brushed. It was smooth as a baby’s bottom — which may appeal to some, but I like a little grain and roughness. There are other niggles that come from the buttons. While they had nice tactile feedback which felt really premium, the power button shifts around a little too much and if you apply pressure to the center of the volume rockers you will be greeted with an incredibly unpleasant flex. Since this isn’t really a high-end device, you can’t really expect much when it comes to performance. It sports a Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. With proper optimisation, those specs would do fine for light to medium tasks, but from our brief hands-on it doesn’t seem to be the case. Switching between applications was slow and sluggish. Exiting the camera app was the most painful thing to watch as the frames stuttered and choked. It was a disaster. That said, this can probably be fixed with a quick update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The honor 5X comes with a decent 13-megapixel f/2.0 main camera with a dual-LED flash mounted on the rear, right above the fingerprint scanner. It’s a pretty decent snapper with a host of features as is the hallmark of EMUI’s camera app. Stuff like beautification, HDR, panorama are all bundled into it. Shots from that sensor are decent with reasonable amounts of colour accuracy and detail. The front 5MP f/2.4 selfie cam also takes reasonably good pictures, though we would have liked if it was a little wider for those crucial wefies. Its Huawei-made fingerprint scanner is as fantastic as ever. I loved the accuracy and speed though I would have appreciated a little haptic feedback when it successfully reads your finger but that’s me nitpicking. The honor 5X’s sensor only needs 6 taps to register your fingerprint yet it has an amazing level of accuracy. As is a common theme in Huawei made devices, the fingerprint scanner at the back is more than simply a fingerprint scanner. You can swipe down on it to pull down your notifications, as well as hold it to exit your application and return to the home screen. It also allows you to take photos by tapping it though we found that quite pointless and horribly unergonomic. It also has a curious function that lets the fingerprint scanner act as a back button allowing you to tap it once to go back to your previous task. So what if I’ve enabled the camera single tap to take a photo? Design oversight? It also lacks the swipe left and swipe right to scroll through pictures or text. All in all, it’s a pretty decent budget premium device with an okay camera and decent specs. All it needs is some proper optimisation (please patch ASAP) and a little skill when taking photographs. It’s a decent all-rounder but it faces tough competition from the likes of the   and the   (when it arrives) even if our estimate of a sub RM1,000 price tag comes true."
Cheryl Bates,Acer Predator 8 Review: Made for fun,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/26/acer-predator-8-review-malaysia/,,,2016-01-26,"One of the first of its kind, the Acer Predator 8 is essentially the one of the world firsts in terms of tablets built for gaming.  As far as the design and build go, the Predator 8 isn’t your bog standard tablet. Coming in at about 8 inches in size, the tablet has a rather unique shape; with four front-facing speakers (called the Predator Quadio) with one situated at each corner of the tablet. The tablet is surprisingly light considering how chunky it looks and how solid it feels; weighing in at a paltry 350g with the battery in. The sides are also shaped in a way that you have a decent place to grip without your hands getting in the way of said speakers if you want to play games in landscape mode. One minor gripe is the placement of its microUSB port at the top of the device as the charging cable will get in the way if you are playing games while charging. The rear of the device is home to a brushed metal plate with the Predator logo on it and is the only bit of the tablet that is made of solid metal. The rest of the Predator 8 is made of a combination of plastic and rubber that only simulates that metal finish but still looks good regardless. Due to its unique shape you probably won’t find many 3rd party cases for it, unfortunately, but  . Also, we feel we need to mention that this is the first (compact) gaming tablet that has a form of haptic feedback called the Predator TacSense. There are two haptic motors, with one placed on each side."

Now, though, thanks to Indian import-export tracker Zauba, we at least have confirmation of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge’s screen sizes. 
 Based on this listing, the two devices bearing the model number SM-G930R4 and SM-G935R4 — which is the Galaxy S7 and   respectively — have been listed to pack a 5.1-inch screen for the S7 and a 5.5-inch screen for the S7 edge. This reflects the earlier   outed by popular benchmark AnTuTu. Plus, since only two models have been imported, it is becoming less and less likely that Samsung will launch four devices at the same time. Then again, smartphone manufacturers have done crazier things. Though, it is worth noting that only two of each device have been imported, probably because they’re tester units (as can be seen in the description “FOR TESTNG”). Based on most leaks, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge should come with a Quad HD display packing either an Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 processor (likely depending on region) plus 4GB of RAM and either 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB of expandable internal storage. Yes, there will be a microSD card slot. The camera will probably be a 12-megapixel BRITECELL rear-facing camera and a 5MP front-facing selfie cam. These devices should also have support for Cat.12/13 LTE connectivity and a USB Type-C port. They should also come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. If you’d like to catch up on what we know about the new Galaxy S lineup, you can find more info   and  . We will definitely know more once Samsung’s Unpacked event in Barcelona which will take place in February. Until then, these specifications could change — though we think unlikely because they match up with our earlier   on the Indonesian certification agency — so don’t follow them blindly."

With the growing demand for internet on the go, Power Prepaid now comes with a whopping 3GB of Free Data. You should be impressed by now but wait until you see the full picture. While it looks like you’re getting a whopping 3GB with full speed internet on the surface, the reality is that nothing has changed. As a mobile internet user, you’ll depend mostly on high-speed internet which in this case, remains at 1GB for free. The remaining 2GB extra is for Basic Internet, which is throttled internet at 64kbps.  Previously, when you used up your free 1GB of data, you have a choice to top up more with its   or continue using with slower 64kbps speeds at no extra charges. U Mobile didn’t specify a limit for its throttled usage back then and now they have officially put a cap at 2GB. Assuming there was never a limit in the first place, this could be even seen as a downgrade.

The honor 5X is the much anticipated budget-midrange smartphone from the Chinese company that looks to take on Xiaomi’s very own device in that class — the Redmi Note 3. Clad in an all-metal unibody, the honor 5X comes with a 5.5-inch full HD and packs a Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. It also comes with a 13MP f/2.0 primary camera with a dual-LED flash for taking photos. Selfies are taken care of by the front-facing 5MP f/2.4 snapper. The 5X also sports a large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0, plus a dedicated dual-SIM tray — so none of that hybrid-SIM nonsense. The device will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with the EMUI 3.1 skin on top. As you can tell by the name, the honor 7 Enhanced is slightly improved version of the old (but gold) honor 7. It still packs the same 2.2GHz octa-core Kirin 935 processor paired with 3GB of RAM thrumming under a 5.2-inch full-HD display. It also brings over the honor 7’s 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash plus an 8MP front-facing camera with its own LED flash. What has changed then? It has more storage — double in fact at 32GB from the old 16GB found on the original honor 7. While it may seem like a simple change it is a significant one as one of the biggest qualms users had of this otherwise excellent device was the fact that it had a measly 16GB of onboard storage, which as we all know is not going to be enough especially with that 20MP snapper. This is also the first non-Nexus device to come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box that has been launched in Malaysia."

Not too long ago, The Oatmeal collaborated with Elan Lee and Shane Small to launch a   for their own imaginative card game: Exploding Kittens. It became one of the   projects on Kickstarter and quickly won the hearts of many but it suffered from the limitation of being a physical card game. Now, well…there’s an app for that. Exploding Kittens is a simple and straightforward game to be played with friends. The objective is simple — don’t explode. Each player starts with four cards and a defuse card with a universal draw deck in the middle. Players then take turns to play an action card followed by drawing another card from the deck in the centre. If a player draws a card with an exploding kitten, they will have to defuse the card or get blown up and ejected from the game. It continues until only one player is left. The app version of the game promises to be exactly the same. That means you get to have all the brilliant drawings of The Oatmeal, plus the simple and addictive mechanics of the game.

OPPO are so committed to the selfie abilities of this smartphone that they’ve even hired “Selfie Ambassador” Nora Danish to demonstrate just how powerful this device is at taking selfies. 
 Let’s start with the build. If you’ve been following our coverage of the OPPO F1, I’m sure you would have noticed how similar this device is with the OPPO R7 series. It so happened we had an OPPO R7s on hand so we placed the two devices side by side. Quickly, which device is which? Honestly, besides the size and the back firing speaker grille, these two devices are almost exactly the same from the back. The camera module, the flash, the two toned rear panels (because of the different materials), the feel and the rounded edges were all exactly the same. It was unreal. Since it was exactly the same, it also had the same feel in the hand as the R7s — albeit the smaller footprint — so that part didn’t feel so good. Then again, for a midrange device, you can’t really complain. Around the front, that’s a different story. The front bears enough differences to identify which is which. Opting for capacitive buttons instead of the on-screen ones on the R7s, the F1 lets you use its display to its maximum potential. Not that it had a very impressive display, but we’ll get into that later. What I did like was the rounded front edges. With the 2.5D glass set to curve slightly more and slightly later, the glass and the metal blended seamlessly into each other giving the device a nice rounded edge. It was almost iPhone 6s Plus like, so props to OPPO for acheiving the something like that on a midrange device. Beyond that, the device felt generally nice in the hand — though I would have liked it a little more if it had a slight curve, but that’s up to the individual. The OPPO F1 is powered by a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. At the front, the device sports a 5-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) IPS panel which isn’t all that impressive. The device comes running Android 5.1 Lollipop with OPPO’s ColorOS 2.1 running on top. The device draws juice from a 2,500 mAh battery and also has support for dual-SIM (Micro+Nano) although since it’s a hybrid set up you will have to sacrifice a microSD slot for the second SIM. Performance was pretty decent. It didn’t lag when switching between applications (though there weren’t many applications pre-installed to begin with) and it handled what little multitasking I threw at it. I’m not particularly a fan of the ColorOS Android skin, but some of you may like it so that’s ultimately down to personal preference. The display was okay-ish and you probably wouldn’t notice the 720p-ness unless you’re coming from a higher screen resolution. Now we get to the part everyone has been waiting for — the camera. It packs a 13-megapixel ISOCELL rear shooter with Phase Detection AF and a large f/2.2 aperture that was pretty good in the venue’s sketchy lighting. It took decent shots, but since we could only view it on a 720p screen, we won’t make any claims just yet. What everyone’s curious about is the 8MP front-facing snapper. When you think of a “selfie phone”, you’d think of something like the   which sports a massive 13MP front facing selfie shooter with autofocus and dual LED flash for RM1,049. Next to those beastly specs, the OPPO F1 that costs RM1,198 simply pales in comparison. It doesn’t even have a front facing flash — instead it relies on a “screen flash”, which basically turns your screen white and bright, to illuminate dark subjects. Probably best used in dark conditions, the screen flash did absolutely nothing in the launch venue’s dodgy lighting, but again we will have to fully test this out before we make any judgements. When you think about this phone, you can’t go at it purely from a specs perspective. If you were to do that, perhaps the ZenFone Selfie is the better device with it’s 5.5″ full HD display, but look at it. It’s chunky, it’s fat and it is very plasticky. The OPPO F1 on the other hand, is a slim thing with a great build and a premium feel. It’s rounded metal rails and smooth metallic back are awesome to run your hand across. It’s the phone for the fashionista, for someone who cares more about style and looks than pure hardware specs. Let me put it this way, could you see Nora Danish using a ZenFone Selfie?"

Or 5e. Whatever the name though, this Apple smartphone is said to have a smaller 4-inch display and should be unveiled in March. Now a video has surfaced, claiming to be the “First real 4-inch iPhone 2016″ video leak, the short 40-second clip — if true — does give at least some information on Apple’s purported next product. Yeah, it looks exactly like an iPhone 6/6s. In fact, it looks so much like an iPhone 6/6s that many are calling this video a fake and that the reason it looks small-ish is because the guy manning the camera has large hands. Honestly, it does look kind of sketchy and as 9to5Mac pointed out, the speaker grille ratios were pretty similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone so that does add some credence to the “big-hands” justification. It is said that MIC Gadget has a reasonable history in obtaining devices for a hands-on ahead of time so maybe there is some truth to all of this. But, there is no way of identifying if this is actually the new iPhone 6C or if it is just a regular iPhone 6. There’s tape over many of the important identifier bits, there is no comparison with the iPhone 6/6s, and there is really nothing in the room that can tell us anything about the scale of this device. Considering how good   have gotten, it honestly wouldn’t be too surprising if the phone in the video is actually a clone made to look like it could be the iPhone 6c. There have been many fakes in the past, some running an iOS skinned version of Android, some just flat out running Android, but it seems that there are plenty of people who can’t tell the difference: Clearly many are willing to believe anything people tell them, so perhaps this guy is banking on the gullibility of society? Who knows. What we do know is that you shouldn’t believe everything someone tells you. So, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt. What do you think of this device and its “hands-on” video? Does it look legit? Would you buy one? Why did they make it look exactly the same as the iPhone 6/6s instead of going down the iPhone 5c route? Let us know in the comments below."

Since Malaysia is a key market, we anticipated a local launch would follow soon after and sure enough, OPPO have brought this mid-range device to our shores. Despite the name, the F1 has nothing to do with the popular motorsport Formula 1. It does, however, look like the splitting image of the smartphones from OPPO’s R7 line, from white front panel right down to the square rear-mounted camera module and flash. The resemblance is uncanny. The device has a relatively small 5″ 720p HD display (1280×720 pixels) with a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor on the inside paired with 3GB of RAM for a pretty decent spec list. Internal storage is a tiny 16GB but that’s expandable via microSD for up to 128GB of extra storage. This smartphone also has support for dual-SIM (one Micro and one Nano) but since it’s a hybrid SIM set up, you will have to sacrifice one slot if you want to use a microSD card. This smartphone promises a “premium” photography experience at a reasonable price, so it gets a 13MP ISOCELL f/2.2 aperture rear-facing camera with Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) and a single LED flash. On the front, it packs an 8-megapixel f/2.0 snapper with a 1/4-inch sensor and built-in beautification features. Powering the device will be a modest 2,500 mAh battery which is a touch more than the OPPO R7 Lite and R7 models. It will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop with ColorOS 2.1 running on top. With those specs, this places the OPPO F1 right in the Xiaomi Redmi 3’s crosshairs. The F1 should have the edge in terms of performance though as it has 3GB of RAM versus the Redmi 3’s 2GB, but that extra performance does come with a higher price tag. The only question is how much lower will the Redmi 3 retail at? The OPPO F1 officially goes on sale online tomorrow, 22 January 2016, at midnight on the   for RM1,198. The first 200 customers to purchase this device from the online store will receive a free OPPO Selfie Stick.

When abused, it can cause adverse effects. That’s what Communication and Multimedia Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Salleh Said Keruak believes as the government is mulling for tougher enforcements for online users. According to the minister, social media is often abused for defaming and to incite hatred against leaders and the institutions of government. To put an end to these issues, the government is pushing to amend the MCMC Act in March, which will give it more powers to act on such abusers. The police will work closely with the MCMC in their investigations. To speed up the process, a dedicated deputy public prosecutor has been appointed by the Attorney-General’s Chambers to handle social media cases.   The new amendment could also allow more websites to be blocked, especially those that are seen to be threatening the peace and violating the Sedition Act. One such site is Sarawak Report, which he says has been spreading lies against the government and it creates confusion among the people. The minister has also added that he hopes Malaysians won’t view this in a negative light as it was necessary to safeguard the public’s interest. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen such warning. In the middle of last year, MCMC had   advising Malaysians against spreading lies on 1MDB.  Once the amendment is passed in 2 months time, you better think twice before making slanderous statements on your Facebook, Twitter and other social channels. That one rant could win you a “Go to Jail” card.  There are a lot of nasty things being posted on social media these days but there’s a difference between offensive and defamatory. Will the police and MCMC be able to tell the difference between the two? In the UK, there had been several cases of   for being offensive.  What do you think of this MCMC Act amendment? Will it make Malaysians more responsible online or will it suppress our freedom of speech?"

A few days ago, we saw the new Galaxy A trio  . Now, we’ve just received an email indicating that Samsung will be launching these new devices — the  ,   and   — next week. Samsung Malaysia has set the official unveiling of the Galaxy A line for 28 January 2016  which is next Thursday. The Galaxy A series will share the Galaxy S6’s good looks with its glass front and back panels held together by a metal frame. The edges are rounded for a better grip and feel in the hand. The devices also get a bump, across the line, up to a 13-megapixel f/1,9 aperture rear shooter and a front-facing 5MP f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates the Galaxy A3’s camera from the other two bigger devices is the lack of OIS though we suspect people who are going for a budget device won’t mind this too much. The best part? All three devices have a Pink Gold colour option — which we hope they will bring to Malaysia as well. Sitting at the top of the Galaxy A’s pecking order is the largest of the trio with a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED display. On the inside, the devices will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. Thankfully the internal storage is expandable via microSD to up to 128GB of extra internal storage. The Galaxy A7 also gets a large 3,300 mAh battery. Next up we have the Galaxy A5 which is slightly smaller at 5.2″ but with the same full-HD (1920×1080) Super AMOLED display. Powering the device will be a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. However, it gets a smaller 2,900 mAh battery for juice. Rounding out the trio is the smallest sibling, the Galaxy A3. Sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280×720) Super AMOLED display with a quad-core 1.5GHz processor running on the inside. It also packs 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. The device will be drawing power from a 2,300 mAh battery. The trio of devices will not launch with Android 6.0 Marshmallow though, as they’re set to come with Android 5.1 Lollipop out-of-the-box. That said, we do expect them to get Marshmallow within a reasonable amount of time. The two higher end devices — the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 — also sport a fingerprint scanner. Those are mighty specs for a budget device, but only if these devices are actually priced like a budget device. Based on the Singaporean pricing of the Galaxy A line, that doesn’t really look to be the case. In Singapore, the Galaxy A3 is going for SGD398 (around RM1,211),  while the Galaxy A5 costs SGD598 (around RM1,820) and the biggest Galaxy A7 will set you back SGD698 (around RM2,125). A pretty hefty price tag then. Then again, Singapore’s prices have generally been much higher than in Malaysia. If we’re going off last year’s Malaysian pricing, the Galaxy A3 went for RM899, Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199 and the Galaxy A7 had an RM1,499 price tag. But, keep in mind that these prices were before GST."

Rory Lee,Here’s why we think the “Indonesian Iron Man” is fake,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/20/heres-why-we-think-the-indonesian-iron-man-is-fake/,,,2016-01-20,"By now, I’m sure most of you have seen a video making its rounds on social media, and even  , about a guy with a robotic arm that he built in a garage to help him overcome the limitations of his paralysed left hand. Sounds amazing right? Yeah, we think this sounds too good to be true. Here’s why. I Wayan Sutawan, affectionately referred to as Tawan, suffered a minor stroke six months ago which paralysed his left arm. Because he’s a mechanic of sorts, one can imagine that having a paralysed left hand can be quite a cumbersome thing. So, rather than sit around and whine about it, Tawan set to work and in two months created a robotic arm out of spare parts he had around his workshop. He can control the robot arm via a headband around his forehead that picks up his brain signals and allows him to control the arm movement accordingly. Based on the video, not only can he lift objects and move his arm around, he can also pick up and hold on to rather delicate objects. So why do we think this miraculous feat has more in common with the Boy Who Cried Wolf than it does with Iron Man? That means the body part — the muscles, the nerve cells, the tendons and ligaments — are perfectly functional, there is just nothing telling them to move. So, if it’s the brain that can’t issue the command, how then can his “brainwave detector” — that looks like a bunch of LEDs strapped around his head with duct tape — detect the brainwaves issued by a part of the brain that no longer functions? Plus, even if that contraption around his head   pick up the brainwaves from dead/damaged braincells that can no longer issue commands via a human’s regular nervous system, where on earth did he store the processor needed to make sense of those brainwaves (or even identify the correct ones) and translate them into mechanical motor functions? How did he develop such sophisticated programming? What kind of supercomputing power is being used to digest all that data? While the motors and the hydraulics for the upper segments of the arm could possibly pass off as motors to facilitate movement, the glove that controls Tawan’s finer finger movements don’t have any actuators at all. So how could this contraption allow him to make the finger movements necessary to pick up and grip the solder in the video? Prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by the brain aren’t exactly new. Take a look at this   by The Guardian on a DARPA-funded research project for robotic arms that can feel. What the scientists at Johns Hopkins university Applied Physics Laboratory did was have the electrodes from the prosthetic hand inserted into his sensory and motor cortexes so that he could not only control the hand with thought, he could also feel and sense when his “fingers” were touched. Once again, this is proof that in order for your brain to control a prosthetic arm, the necessary cortexes would have to be able to send a signal and function properly first. Another thing to note is that if a project led by the brilliant scientists of Johns Hopkins needed funding from a US military agency like DARPA to succeed, how on earth did Tawan manage to build one himself out of spare parts? What is more likely is that the man simply has a weak arm that needs some motorised help to actually function properly. In fact, if you pay close attention to his left arm when he is inserting it into his mechanical contraption, you can see his wrist flick upwards before it enters the sleeve. Everything about this story seems too sketchy to be true. The fact that a simple mechanic from a rural town could just one day up and build something so advanced from spare parts should have raised at least a few flags. Add “brainwave-controlled” to that description and you would have a beautiful script to a story designed for the big screen. You would have Iron Man actually. And Tony Stark doesn’t exist — no matter how hard Elon Musk tries."
Rory Lee,We’ve broken the AppLock -Fingerprint- “encryption” and it wasn’t even that difficult,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/21/weve-broken-the-applock-fingerprint-encryption-and-it-wasnt-even-that-difficult/,"AppLock,AppLock Fingerprint,Fingerprint decrypted,Fingerprint encryption","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS,Others",2016-01-21,"We’ve touched on how good the Nexus 6P’s fingerprint sensor is in the past with its quick unlock speed and high accuracy despite only needing six taps to register your finger. You can also use it to authenticate Google Play as well as Android Pay purchases, but we’ve always hoped it could do more especially since Google baked fingerprint support into Android 6.0 Marshmallow itself. Thanks to the open API though, now you can use your fingerprint to lock specific apps in your phone — but there’s a catch. App locking is no new concept. It simply allows you to lock specific applications, requiring either a password or pin to access that particular app. Let’s say, your friends are the nosy bunch and the moment they get their hands on your device, they like to head into the gallery to look at all your embarrassing failed selfie attempts. Thanks to an app locker, you can stop that by protecting access to that application with an app locker. Some devices even have that natively in their Android skin, while others even allow you to lock entire folders of applications. Entering a password is   last century and developer SurpriseToYou have come up with AppLock -Fingerprint-, an app that lets you (if you’re on Android 6.0 Marshmallow) lock individual applications in your phone with your fingerprint. Although we must note the incredibly sketchy developer name. When I’m using a security app, I don’t really want it to surprise me. To use it, the app requires you to grant it three different levels of access — Apps with usage access, Draw over other apps, and Activate device administrator. Once in, it’s a simple task of choosing which application you want locked by flicking the toggle next to that specific app. Once you launch the app that you’ve locked, the AppLock -Fingerprint- overlay will draw over the app and ask for your fingerprint. But, true to the developer’s name, here’s the surprise — when that overlay pops up and “locks” your app, should you receive a banner notification from WhatsApp, the overlay drops and you have access to said “locked” app without ever inputting your fingerprint. What kind of security is this?! While the fact that this app runs on ads without a way to disable it is a little annoying, I think the far more pressing issue is the fact that you can break the “encryption” with a single banner notification. If, however, that doesn’t bother you and you’re interested in this app, you can get it from the PlayStore. Just, erm I don’t know, turn off your banner notifications in the mean time?"

Rory Lee,Did you damage your device? Soon it’ll bleed to let you know,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/20/did-you-damage-your-device-soon-itll-bleed-to-let-you-know/,"bleed,car bleeding,casing bleed,color changing polymer,colour changing polymer,early damage detection,how to see tiny cracks,polymer coating","Cool stuff,Others",2016-01-20,"Sometimes, a tiny crack is all it takes to cause severe damage to an object. It’s these tiny cracks that we don’t see because they’re often impossible to spot in, for example, your car’s windscreen. However, these cracks become the first weaknesses in any object and could potentially lead to something really bad somewhere down the road. Well, a University of Illinois research has led to a   coating that could be an important early damage warning system, making it easier to find cracks or damage in particular objects by making them bleed. This polymer coating consists of tiny micro beads that crack open, causing a chemical reaction that will visibly highlight any damage with colour. These beads are pH sensitive so any damage will cause a colour change — from yellow to red — without the need for additional chemicals. The bigger the crack or scratch, the deeper the object will bleed as more capsules are affected. What’s good about this coating is that it works on multiple kinds of polymers that can coat metals, other polymers and even glass. Plus, they’re apparently not too expensive either, but no specific quote of a price was given. What’s more, the coating shows no sign of degradation — meaning the microcapsules will stay intact until actual cracks or damage happens. The application possibilities of this technology are endless. Since only 5% of a polymer needs to be microcapsules to have a strong damage indication ability, you can apply it to a myriad of things. While this can prove useful to big projects like rocket launches into space as well as deep sea exploration, there are also plenty of everyday products that can benefit. Off the top of my head would be your action cam/smartphone’s waterproof casing. Those things are transparent so it’s incredible difficult to find small cracks in their seal, but all it takes is a little nick to let the water in and damage your precious device. Planes and vehicles stand to benefit from this polymer too, as important components in these machines can be coated to allow for early damage detection which could potentially save lives. It’s kind of nice to think that your car could bleed for you before you have to bleed yourself."

Unfortunately, some applications are really heavy and take up a lot of resources, slowing down slower phones. One of which is the   application. It takes up a whopping amount of space in your internal storage versus something like Instagram that only uses a fraction of the amount, but because this is the only and most complete application for browsing Facebook, we begrudgingly use it. Common perception would be that the mobile browser version is always a whole lot worse than the app, but according to Android Central, that isn’t the case. Russell Holly wrote an   about how he uninstalled Facebook on his Android device and it turned out to be a better experience than he expected. That got us thinking, is the Facebook app really worth it? Well, for what we believe is the majority of FB users, we doubt it. Here are the five reasons we think   users should ditch the Facebook application. If you’re on it for a moderate amount of time a day, you will notice that it becomes one of the biggest battery drainers on your phone. Plus, it is a performance hog too, something Russell also notes, so it will significantly slow down the performance of lower-end devices."

While all of that were just rumours before this, now we have what looks like actual confirmation of what the device will look like as well as some of its hardware features. Android Authority received an exclusive tip from Shai Mizrachi in which they came into possession of several LG G5 diagrams showing exactly what the phone will look like on the outside as well as its dimensions. Based on the diagram, it does indeed look like the phone will have a flat design unlike that of the previous   and   models. Besides that the diagram confirms that the G5’s volume control buttons will be placed at the side of the smartphone while the power button remains put beneath the camera module (likely where the fingerprint sensor will reside as well). It does seems kind of silly to have a clickable button at the back, but then again we’ve doubted the back button placement before and that turned out pretty well in the end. Speaking of that camera module, while it does look like a massive module, it seems that there will only be one camera at the back. Judging from the cutout in the middle plus the earlier concepts by CNet Korea, the rest of to module will be home to the dual-tone LED flash and a laser autofocus. It also looks like the G5 will indeed be thinner, taller and wider than the LG G4, measuring in at 149.4 x 73.9 x 8.2mm versus the G4’s 148.9 x 76.1 x 6.3-9.8mm. Unfortunately, while this diagram does confirm a lot about the device, there is no mention of specs or what exactly the body will be made of. If we’re going off past rumours the G5 should have a 5.7-inch QHD display plus an all metal body with a removable battery that can be slid out by   off the bottom or top of the device. [ ]"

We just received the invite in our mail stating that honor are planning to launch both devices at the same time on January 26, next Tuesday. Suffice to say we will be bringing you live updates from the ground on that very day. Of the two devices launched, the honor 5X is definitely the more interesting one. The 5X is honor’s answer to the  , with it’s full metal build as well as rear mounted fingerprint scanner. The 5.5″ device will sport a full HD screen plus a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor — a departure from their home-grown Kirin SoCs. Nevertheless, the Snapdragon 616 will be paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. What it does have over the Redmi Note 3 is a dedicated microSD card slot which allows you to expand that small internal memory. Because of the fact that honor ditched the hybrid SIM set up, users can use two SIM cards and the microSD storage simultaneously. It will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with their EMUI 3.1 skin running over it. For camera optics, the device will sport a 13MP f/2.0 primary shooter with dual-LED flash to help out in low light conditions, as well as a 5-megapixel f/2.4 front shooter. The phone will draw power from a fairly large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0. The honor 5X is going for RMB1,099 in China (around RM730) which is only a touch higher than the Redmi Note 3’s 16GB version and the same price as the 32GB version. In Malaysia you can get an imported Redmi Note 3 ( ) for under RM1,000, so the question is: How low will honor go? The honor 7 Enhanced isn’t all that different than the already good un-enhanced version which we   a lot. The only enhancement is the fact that this device will now come with 32GB of internal storage and Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. While the bump in storage from 16GB might not be that big of a deal to some, many felt that one of the biggest problems with the honor 7 was the lack of storage space. Now with double that, this device just got a whole lot better. Besides that, this will be the first non-nexus smartphone in Malaysia to be officially sold with Android M out-of-the-box. So, you get to have all those awesome Marshmallow features to yourself. The device features a 5.2″ full HD display on the front with an octa-core Kirin 935 processor clocked at 2.2GHz paired with 3GB of RAM. Camera-wise it has a 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash. The front camera is an 8MP unit with its own front-facing flash to help with those low-light selfies."

This is because WhatsApp realises that many of their customers did not possess credit or debit cards and were afraid of losing their access to this service. According to the company, nearly a billion people around the world rely on this app to stay in touch with their friends and family across the globe. Since this app can basically let you reach as far as there is some semblance of an Internet connection, rural folks were worried that — due to their limited to non-existent access to banking services — they would lose this connection to their loved ones. Besides that, WhatsApp has also ensured their users that they would not be resorting to third-party advertisements on their application to generate income. Instead, they’re testing tools that will allow users to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organisations that they want to talk to. Think of it as a messaging gateway for enterprises.  For example, you could possibly communicate with your bank about whether a recent transaction was fraudulent or with an airline about your recent flight delay. Also imagine being able to receive TAC PIN number from your bank on WhatsApp instead of SMS. This means instant updates that could otherwise take hours — a good idea in concept at least. The thing about this is, have you ever paid for WhatsApp? Yeah sure, some of you early adopters on   and   might have had to pay USD0.99 (RM4.40), but I think the rest of us haven’t paid for it once.

Of course, if you’re already reading this on your smartphone then I do apologise for being an idiot by choosing this intro, but I digress. How does your smartphone  ? And no, I don’t mean this in a metaphorical out-of-body-experience sense, I mean this in a literal sense. We spend every waking moment (some sleeping) of our lives holding onto a little brick that probably weighs no more than a really heavy spoon at a posh restaurant, but most of us put little to no thought into how a device feels in the hand when deciding on a purchase. It’s all about specs and that’s rather unfortunate. I was scrolling lazily through  one day when I noticed an interesting   by   (props for the dope name) asking the subreddit about what Android phone they felt had the best feel in the hand. Honestly, the responses surprised me — there were a surprising number of non-metal smartphones. That got me thinking, what   the best feeling smartphone I’ve ever held in my hand? With all the smartphone manufacturers pursuing metal and glass bodied phones as the agreed ‘standard’ for a premium build and feel, the question becomes: Does that really give the best feel in the hand? Based on the Reddit thread the answer was no. So, I asked the other writers here at SoyaCincau.com, as well as the other sites under the  , to see if we could find out."

What’s more, the fourth device will feature a dual rear camera setup. According to a report on VentureBeat by Evan Blass, otherwise known as  , Huawei’s P9 lineup will include the regular P9, a budget-friendly P9lite, a larger P9max as well as an unnamed “feature-enhanced P9″. Although Blass noted that his source fell short of dubbing it a premium model, this enhanced P9 is said to feature a larger screen (though not as large as the P9max) more RAM, more internal storage as well as a dual 12-megapixel rear-facing camera. This isn’t new for the Chinese smartphone manufacturer however as they’ve already tried the dual-camera set up on the 2014-2015  . In fact, this new P9’s camera is supposed to be a second generation upgrade of that very dual-camera. Therefore, it will likely mean that the P9’s dual-camera will offer the same additional features afforded by the honor 6 Plus’ like post-capture refocus, simulated aperture adjustment and filter application plus what VentureBeat says will be “even more unique capabilities” as this camera concept has been further refined. Is two better than one? If our   on the upcoming LG G5 is any indication, it would appear smartphone manufacturers definitely think so, as that device is rumoured to sport not only a dual-screen setup like the LG V10 but also a dual rear mounted camera. That said, these are merely rumours as there has been no official confirmation beyond a person with alleged knowledge of Huawei so take this with a grain of salt. One thing is for sure though none of the P9 variants will feature a QHD resolution screen (2560×1440 pixels). As with all Huawei devices (except the Nexus 6P which we can all argue can be considered more of a Google device), the company feels that the slightly better screen and image quality offered by a QHD screen just isn’t worth the shorter battery life. We were pretty   with the Mate S’ battery life, so maybe they do know what they’re doing. As far as specs are concerned, Blass’ source didn’t reveal anything, but we did come across a device that posted a   on Geekbench that we believe could be the Kirin 950-powered Huawei P9. With that kind of horsepower and now a dual-camera, suffice to say we’re excited. Despite all of this information and anticipation, Blass indicates that Huawei will not launch these smartphones during the Barcelona Mobile World Congress’ timeframe, choosing instead to give them a dedicated launch several weeks after MWC. However, it is said that Huawei is expected to unveil a Surface Book-like 2-in-1 in Barcelona next month but there are unfortunately no details on this product for the time being. [ ]"

Sometimes, accidents happen and it seems that   has picked up on that as they’ve quietly fixed this gigantic flaw with the S Pen via a hardware modification to their newer Galaxy Note5 models. But, as there is no way of telling if your device has the fix, please don’t try this with your own device. Based on the image, it looks like Samsung have added a little lever (left) to the original circuit board which looks like it will allow users to eject the S Pen if it were inserted the wrong way. According to Phandroid’s sources, this new mechanism works beautifully despite the fact that it looks like it is being held together by some tape. We don’t think that’s how Samsung will actually hold the lever there, but if there is a fix for this issue it is pretty good news. However, since Samsung made the oversight in the first place, we’re sure many of the early Galaxy Note5 adopters must be pissed that their device doesn’t have this hardware fix. Plus, since Samsung seems to have ninja-fixed this, it doesn’t look like they want others to find out about it which is kind of a bummer. While we’d like to hope that Samsung will offer a hotfix for this problem to existing Galaxy Note5 users, we highly doubt that will be the case. Do you own a Galaxy Note5?

Now the word “optical zoom” may not be a term everyone recognises. Some of you might be thinking that your current smartphones can zoom jolly well, so why would you bother about this device? You see, the zoom commonly found on your smartphone camera is what people call “digital zoom” which essentially crops the image to a smaller frame and enlarges to make it seem like you’re bringing the subject closer to you. No lens movement happens within the camera module. On the other hand, conventional DSLRs and their respective lenses use “optical zoom” which works when the different elements that make up a lens move around to refract light differently, bringing the image closer to you. The biggest difference though is that when you use digital zoom to zoom in on a subject, you lose quality, because you are no longer using the full image — rather you’re only using a cropped fraction of it. Optical zoom then is the way to go if you want to zoom (but not with your feet) and you don’t want to lose image quality at the same time. If the benefits are so great, why don’t more manufacturers equip their smartphones with optical zoom? The biggest reason is size. With more than one element in your lens, the whole camera module tends to get pretty ginormous. Think   or the  . However, with ASUS’s 13-megapixel camera on the ZenFone Zoom, they have used a special dual-periscope design to mount the camera horizontally across the back of the smartphone, letting them hide the camera bump with the ZenFone’s signature curved back."

However, there is also word that this could be the last Lumia smartphone of this year. So,   anyone? According to Windows Central, multiple sources have confirmed with them that February 1 will be the date that Microsoft reveals details about the device including pricing and availability. This device is said to feature a 5-inch 1280×720 pixel HD display with a quad-core Snapdragon 212 (or 200) processor with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD). It is also said to have an 8MP/5MP rear-front camera combo with an LED flash.

Then again that article also said that the Lumia 550 was cancelled, so, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt. With the abrupt cancellation of both Lumia devices, it is unlikely that Microsoft will sit on their hands and not launch any more mobile devices this year. So if there are no more Lumias what else does Microsoft have in their pipeline? A Surface Phone perhaps? An earlier report by Windows Central indicated that the much-anticipated smartphone developed by Microsoft’s Surface team — for now dubbed the Surface Phone — could see a release in the  .

Unless their software game takes a significant step up where you can actually see people moving from other operating systems to Windows 10 (mobile), all the brilliant hardware in the world won’t be able to save you.

Android Authority has reached out for further clarification but has yet to hear back. Sony already has a lot on their plate and if these issues keep cropping up, they better make sure their next flagship makes the cut. This is their first run at such technology on their devices and while we could argue they should’ve perfected it before putting it out, we’ll cut them some slack. This move could be a good one, provided that they make changes to the prices to reflect the lack of a fingerprint sensor. Maybe Americans are better off not dealing with the annoying fingerprint sensor that we talked about in our   of the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual. It’ll save them a lot of pain.

Rory Lee,ASUS ZenFone Zoom hands-on and first impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/14/asus-zenfone-zoom-malaysia-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"Asus,ASUS Malaysia,ASUS ZenFone Zoom,ASUS ZenFone Zoom hands on,ASUS ZenFone Zoom Malaysia,ASUS Zenfone Zoom Malaysia launch,ZenFone Zoom,ZenFone Zoom first impressions,ZenFone Zoom hands on,ZenFone Zoom impressions,ZenFone Zoom Malaysia","Android,Asus,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-14,"Yesterday,   officially launched the much anticipated   on Malaysia and we got to spend some time with their new flagship device. Here’s what we think of it. Do note that the white unit with the black camera module is a prototype given to professional photographer Peter Tan. Of course, this device’s party piece lies in its massive camera module that dominates the back of the phone. Its 13-megapixel Panasonic SmartFSI sensor has a 10-element f/2.7-4.8 aperture lens that utilises a dual-periscope horizontal-mount design allowing it to not only have a massive 3x optical zoom, but also maintain a relatively thin form factor.   Besides that the primary camera comes with other goodies like optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus and a dual-tone LED flash. To help the camera out in low light, the ZenFone Zoom comes with ASUS’ Pixel Master 2.0 technology which is renown for its low light and long exposure capabilities. If 13-megapixels isn’t enough, ASUS have bundled a Super Resolution function into the camera which allows it to take gigantic 52-megapixel photos, by stitching four 13MP shots together for more detail and clarity. While the sample shots on display (taken by Peter Tan) looked rather impressive, we would have to fully test out the functions for ourselves before making a decision. Being a camera-centric phone, the smartphone comes with dedicated camera hardware buttons — a dedicated shutter and video record button — which were awesome and tactile. The device also has equally tactile dedicated zoom keys that can double as volume rockers when not in the camera app. Zooming in and out with the keys was pretty satisfying as the phone gives you a little buzz when it hits the maximum 3x optical zoom. We did notice that launching the camera from the shutter button (which you can do by holding it down) was a little slow (maybe 2-3) seconds. Besides that, the shutter speed and time between shots were not as snappy as something like an iPhone 6s or a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+. However, it does have a complete manual mode with full manual controls that can be easily accessed via a tap of the M button located to the top of the on-screen shutter button. What we were impressed with was the macro capabilities of this device. ASUS boasts a 5cm macro focal distance and from our brief testing, you could get pretty darn close to the subject and still focus with no problems. The front camera is an average 5MP f/2.0 unit with a wide-angle lens and support for Pano Selfie. For a better understanding of this device’s cameras and what optical versus digital zoom really means, stay tuned for our camera comparison. Spec wise, the ZenFone Zoom isn’t all that different from ASUS’ previous flagship, the  . It has an updated quad-core Intel Atom Z3590 processor clocked at 2.5GHz paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable (via microSD up to 64GB) storage. The smartphone also comes running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS’ ZenUI running on top. It’s a shame that it isn’t a more updated version of Android but we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update. Connectivity wise, the device will have a single 4G LTE micro-SIM slot and will have support for up to 802.11ac WiFi. From our brief hands-on, though, the device handles itself quite well, not stuttering or lagging when switching between applications, then again with 4GB of RAM and a high-end Intel chip, this isn’t really surprising. Being a premium phone, it is definitely built well. The nice rounded metal rails were fabulous to hold in the hand and the back curved nicely to fit in our palms. The camera unit is barely noticeable, letting you believe that it could just be a normal camera. Kudos to ASUS for hiding such a beast of a lens array. ASUS says that the leather on the back of the device is real leather, not some faux nonsense, and we were inclined to believe them…until we took the rear panel off. But, when we held the panel by itself, we started to doubt their claims. That said, the stitching around the “ergonomic hump” is real as we could move the thread around. It felt flimsy and plasticky so be careful when you rip that baby off. The bump on the back to help ergonomics was interesting, to say the least, and we quite liked it since it helped a little with the ergonomics. But as most of us usually take photos with a certain finger positions (like pictured earlier), we didn’t really notice it helping much with grip. What did feel nice were once again the metal rails and those fantastic buttons. ASUS also includes a wrist strap that attaches itself to the back of the device, which is a nice touch. As a whole it was fantastic to hold in the hand and it definitely feels like the premium price you’re paying for. However, do note that from the devices on display, there was a difference between the front of the device between the black model and the white model. The black one will remind you of every other ZenFone model with that familiar chin, but the white one seems to have done away with the chin, instead moving the ASUS logo to the bottom of the device. The device is priced at RM2,099 and ASUS says that the device will be available locally at the end of January."

Rory Lee,Netflix is sick and tired of your VPN and Proxies,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/15/netflix-is-sick-and-tired-of-your-vpn-and-proxies/,"Netflix,Netflix blocking proxy,Netflix blocking VPN,Netflix Malaysia,Netflix Malaysia proxy,Netflix Malaysia VPN,Netflix Proxy,Netflix VPN,proxy,vpn","Android,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS,Windows 10",2016-01-15,"recently went “global” and everyone got very excited. We’ve all heard good things about this streaming service, from the shows they have to the quality of their stream plus all the Netflix exclusives like Daredevil and Jessica Jones. It’s gotten so popular that we see it mentioned in TV shows themselves, that one time in Suits when Mike Ross wanted to piss Edward Darby off for example. But, when we took a hard look at their catalogue from our Malaysian accounts, we were quite bummed out that there were so  . Even popular comedy series How I Met Your Mother wasn’t there. So the craftier of us went ahead and used VPNs (Virtual Private Network) and proxies to mask our IP addresses and as a result, gain more access to their content. Well, it seems like Netflix has had enough of our scheming ways and has said openly that they’re putting a stop to VPN users once and for all. For those of you who don’t know what a VPN or proxy does, it basically masks your IP address, preventing a website — Netflix for example — from finding out where you are connecting from. So, with a VPN or proxy you can set it up to have the site or app detect that you’re connecting from an American IP address, for example, then the region locked site would grant you access to their content as if you were coming from the US. If you’d like a more detailed explanation you can head on over to Gizmodo’s article on  . In short when it comes to Netflix, this allows you to bypass region restrictions and circumvent the walls Netflix have put up (because of licensing, censorship and other technical reasons) and have access to whatever content you want — something Netflix is clearly upset about. In a blog statement by Netflix Vice President of Content Delivery Architecture David Fullagar, he said that Netflix would continue to enforce content licensing according to geographical location. However, they did say that they were working on making all their content available to all their subscribers — something they anticipate being able to do. For now, though, they’re focusing on blocking proxies and ensuring that you can only access content from your own region. Although they didn’t say exactly how or when they would block the proxies aside from a vague “as technology continues to evolve and we are evolving with it” line. One possible way we could see them doing it is locking your account by credit card. For example, if you wanted to use an American account, you would have to have an American credit card, likewise, if you’re using a Malaysian credit card you can only access the Malaysian Netflix content. Although they could also take more drastic measures and force you to use your IC/identification numbers to register. Though we doubt it since it would cause some amount of hindrance to user experience. Either way, it looks like your proxy days are numbered.

While we weren’t that surprised that the   was #1 on their list, we were shocked at how MUCH further it was from the competition. Let me give you a hint: 132k. According to the popular cross-platform benchmarker, the average score of an iPhone 6s Plus is 132,620 points, the only device to break the 100k mark in 2015. On paper, this gap doesn’t seem possible as the iPhone 6s Plus is powered by a dual-core Twister A9 chip that is clocked at a tame 1.84GHz  and a PowerVR GT7600 GPU paired with (a frankly depressing) 2GB of RAM. Comparatively, the second placed   packs a monstrous next-gen octa-core Kirin 950 SoC — four Cortex A72 CPU cores clocked at 2.3GHz, four Cortex A53 CPU cores clocked at 1.8GHz and a Mali-T880 MP4 GPU — plus 4GB of RAM. Yet somehow the iPhone 6s Plus outperforms it by about 30%.

So what if you don’t want to have to set your location each morning but still want to find out which is the least congested/fastest way to get to work on time?   has the answer. With the continuous development of Waze, it has become a fantastic navigation app and I personally use it over Google Maps, less because I feel that it is a better navigation app that Maps (which I don’t) and more because of its nifty, user-friendly features. Features like knowing where you’re going based on your history — for example, if you leave for work at 9 AM a few days in a row the app will suggest “work” the next time you fire it up at around the same time of day — as well as changing your route on the fly based on the changing traffic. That said, I do feel that the application updates the routes rather slowly (especially when it comes to congestion) and the navigation isn’t as crisp and informative as Google Maps’. Plus I really hate the way it looks and how slow it is to launch and calculate routes. With Google Maps v9.19 though, it seems that there is an alternative to that. With the acquisition of Waze by the search engine giant,   has slowly integrated more and more of Waze’s features into their own navigation app. Now, along with a whole host of interesting new things, Google Maps has support for Driving Mode — but you’ll have to activate it first. Driving Mode isn’t what you think it means. It doesn’t convert your phone into a landscape screen that has gigantic buttons for doing simple tasks to like answering your phone calls so you won’t get distracted on the road. Instead, it guesses (based on your history) where you’re going and it gives you live updates on the traffic situation as well as the fastest routes to your destination, without the need for you to set a location beforehand. However, thanks to the comments section, users have pointed out that signing out and signing into Maps itself will trigger the feature and unlock the additional options. From there, simply hit “Add Driving shortcut” and you can access this awesome new feature. Once in you will be greeted with the new interface that shows you multicoloured roads (much like Waze) with different colours indicating different levels of congestion. You can then begin your journey or tap the screen once to bring down the menu and set your destination."

The   is said to be following   but new information suggests that they won’t be abandoning the needs of power users. The folks at CNet Korea has posted a render of what the new flagship could look like. Instead of a curvy shape as seen on the G Flex and G4 models, the new G5 will have a flatter design with round edges. Another radical change is the volume rocker and power buttons are now purportedly moved towards the sides. Despite having a full unibody design, the source also claims that the battery is still removable. How is this even possible? Apparently their engineers have made a mechanism that allows the bottom portion to be removed, giving you access to its battery. The lower end of the device will get a drawer-like design that helps to keep dust and water away. When we think of a full unibody design with a removable battery, we thought of the old   that was released about 6 years ago. It had a sturdy body made from a single block of aluminum and the removable cap at the bottom gives you access to its SIM, microSD and removable battery. This was the time when HTC was at its peak.

We thought that nobody would be able to hold a candle to it, much less challenge it. Well, we were wrong because   came out of nowhere and swung a left hook right in the Redmi 3’s face with their new budget smartphone. Affectionately named the Lemon 3, Lenovo’s new device sports a 5-inch 1080p full HD display — which is one up over the Redmi 3’s measly 720p HD panel. On the inside, it is powered by a 1.5GHz Snapdragon 616 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage.

Odd isn’t it that we’ve arrived at a point in time where there is such a thing as a “budget flagship” killer. All the better for consumers, though! The way we see it, your options are clear. Do you want a better screen plus a better set of speakers for a smaller battery, or do you want a massive battery with compromises in the other two departments. With that laser etched lattice-diamond-design-thing, we will give the Redmi 3 a slight edge for now in terms of build, but we’ll have to hold them both before we make a decision.

The images gave us a look at the front of the device but we never got to see the back of it. Now, information has surfaced that suggests the new flagship device could feature two different variants sporting different specs and different back panels. Xiaomi is no stranger to bold choices when it comes to their products. Look at their   series where the   and the   were wildly different — one had a full metal body and a fingerprint scanner — yet they were both launched only two months apart. Would it really surprise you then that they would do something as radical as having two different back panel/constructions on their upcoming flagship device? Well if it comes true that will definitely still surprise me. Of the two devices, the first one is purported to have curved 2.5D glass at the front and the back of the device with a metal frame. Think   or  . This variant is also supposed to feature a 1080p full HD resolution display with the possibility of having 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. On the other hand, the supposed second phone is said to feature an all-metal design — that means full-metal rear housing instead of curved 2.5D glass. Additionally, the device is said to have a higher QHD 2K resolution display and it could possibly house the 4GB RAM/64GB internal storage variant. Other than that, both devices should be identical — sporting a Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor and a 16MP/13MP camera combo with a suggested screen size that can range from 5 to 5.2-inches. The smartphone is also said to have a 3,600 mAh battery and become official by January 21, though sales are only expected to start on February 8. Of course, this is all just guess work based on rumours at this point and for all we know it could be the other way around. That said, this isn’t the first time Xiaomi have done two versions of the same device as the   and   are essentially the same device except for the fact that the Pro variant has a more powerful processor plus more RAM and a higher resolution screen. If these rumours of the Mi 5 are true though, it would be the first time that the Chinese company have gone with two completely different back constructions on a phone.

This is due to blue light emitted from digital screens that can cause eye fatigue. This could even cause   in the long run. With the upcoming iOS 9.3 update for the iPhone and iPad, Apple wants you to sleep better at night with its new “Night Shift” feature.  According to Apple, Night Shift aims to make it easier for you to sleep by making the display more pleasant to your eyes. Using your device’s time and GPS, it will know when it is sunset and would gradually change the display to show warmer colours, cutting down on blue light emission. As a result, it would help to increase   naturally, a vital component to get better sleep at night.  Of course, this isn’t entirely new. Most smartphones from China including Xiaomi, OPPO, Huawei and BenQ have their own low blue light or reading mode that does the same thing. The only difference is that Apple is making it automatic based on your current time.  There’s no mention if there’s an option to turn it off, but we are sure it would be important for those actually working night shifts.  Apart from this low blue light mode, the new iOS 9.3 update will also introduce a multi-user feature for the iPad. This would allow several people to share a single device and the experience will be customised based on their individual profiles. Unfortunately, this appears to be catered for schools and we are not sure if they would extend this to end users as well. On top of that, the native Notes app can be secured with your fingerprints.

Fascinating people who talk about the chassis, drive and power-to-weight ratios of the Ferraris and Lamborghinis that they don’t own, all decked out in their respective car-branded gear. They say that the easiest way to spot that a person does not drive a Ferrari is to look for the guy wearing the Ferrari branded sunglasses/shirt. And since there are many more people who don’t own luxury cars versus people who do, car branded accessories are popping up everywhere. What’s worse is that these “accessories” are usually just overpriced versions of otherwise normal products. Slap a Rolls Royce logo on a microwave and it will probably be worth 10 times more. Bentley has the same idea, and working with luxury phone manufacturer  , they’ve smacked a Bentley badge on a USD9,900 (around RM43,600) phone to create the Vertu Signature Touch for Bentley. My bank account isn’t ready for this. Vertu is renown for being the manufacturer of ultra-premium phones that usually prioritise form over function. But with their latest device, the Signature Touch, they’ve managed to combine the two aspects as it packs an octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor and 4GB of RAM with 64GB of internal storage under that pretty stitched exterior. The Signature Touch also has a 5.2″ 1080p full HD display with sapphire crystal glass. It also sports a 21MP rear shooter with PDAF for their rear camera while the front will have a 2.1MP selfie camera. Powering the device is a 3,100 mAh battery. So what’s the difference between this Signature Touch for Bentley versus the regular Signature Touch? Well, it has a 3D Bentley logo; two-tone Beluga and Hotspur Bentley leather with Hotspur stitching. Besides that, the Signature Touch for Bentley also features knurled side keys, a “unique” pillow rail and sound bar. I know right? Try explaining why this phone is special   sounding pretentious. Other than the potentially absurd price tag, there really is nothing too special about this smartphone that makes it a better phone than a similar flagship. It even runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop. I honestly think it looks really ugly, unnecessarily tacky and frankly quite   (there is really no English word for  ) too. I’d like to say that this automobile-branded-regular-product-fad has gone on for way too long and things are getting out of control so we should all refrain from buying them. But, I know that somewhere out there, there is a guy sitting in his million ringgit car thinking: “Hmm, if only I had a smartphone that costs about the same as a Myvi to match my Bentley…”."

This is to facilitate the push towards Microsoft’s new operating system,  . When we say terminate, we don’t mean that your Windows 8 machine will just up and die or stop working straight away, it’s just that Windows 8 won’t receive updates, security fixes and bug fixes it used to get. If you are running on Windows 8 though, don’t worry because there is a simple way around this issue. Besides the obvious upgrade to Windows 10 being one of the solutions, Windows 8 users can also upgrade to Windows 8.1, which based on their lifecycle fact sheet, will continue to receive updates for two more years until January 9, 2018. If you’ve read the horror stories of Windows 10’s ominous privacy terms and want to avoid such dangers by staying on an older version of Windows, you can now do so. As you can see, today also marks the end of Windows 7 service Pack 1’s mainstream support — but don’t worry you will still continue to receive security updates as extended support will go all the way to January 14, 2020. All you lose is the mainstream support which includes free incident support, warranty claims and fixes for non-security and security bugs, plus design changes and feature requests.

Why is it important to keep your system updated and within Microsoft’s support lifecycle? Well, the first and most obvious reason is security. As operating systems lose their security updates, they become vulnerable to new malware and potential attacks, which puts your information as well as your system at risk. Microsoft, via updates, patches these new vulnerabilities when they come up so that these exploitable holes are fixed. Once that support ends, you lose all protection against future vulnerabilities. Besides Windows 8, Microsoft is also terminating support for older versions of IE, urging users to upgrade either to IE 11 or Microsoft’s new Edge browser. I’ve personally never been a fan of IE because of how messy the interface is and how clunky it makes browsing feel, so it comes as a surprise to me that 20% of the desktop web browser market still uses the older versions of IE (8, 9, 10) as their daily driver. Unfortunately for those people, they will have to migrate to either the new IE 11, Microsoft Edge, or other third party browsers like   or  , or else they would be facing security vulnerabilities when browsing the web. Microsoft Edge, the built-in browser on Windows 10, promised much in terms of functionality and performance. Things like extensions were supposed to come to Edge to keep it up to par with browsers like Google’s Chrome but til this day, there is still   anywhere. I don’t know about you guys but I definitely need my extensions. Killing off old software is nothing new, and I welcome it because not only does it allow software developers to focus on their latest and greatest product, it also allows them to free up valuable resources to focus on new projects. Resources that would otherwise go to updating and patching old software can now be redirected towards either new software or the improvement of current software."

Rory Lee,Anyone can crash your WhatsApp with the power of emojis,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/11/anyone-can-crash-your-whatsapp-with-the-power-of-emojis/,"Android,emoji crash whatsapp,smartphone,Whatsapp,whatsapp crash,whatsapp emoji,WhatsApp vulnerability,whatsapp weakeness","Android,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-01-11,"seems to be full of vulnerabilities these days. At first, it tried to steal your   through a malware in WhatsApp’s update, now it seems that you can crash specific users’ apps by sending them a whole bunch of emojis. 5,000 emojis to be precise. Researcher Indrajeet Bhuyan reveals that people can cause Android versions of the WhatsApp application to crash by sending them at least 5,000 emojis from the web version of WhatsApp. When a user receives the application and tries to open it, the whole app would crash. The only way to recover from that is to delete the entire conversation. Through our experimentation, it does indeed work. When we tried to open the “malicious” message, sure enough, our application crashed and we had to close and restart it before we could access the app again. However, the other conversations were unaffected by the malicious thread, so as long as you leave that conversation alone it won’t crash the application. This also works for group chats. The only way to access that conversation again is to delete the entire thread and start a new conversation with that contact. That said, if you have 4GB of RAM like we did on our Oppo R7s, you can have varying degrees of success in opening the thread again though you would have to wait awhile. This vulnerability does not extend to the iOS version of WhatsApp as the emojis only cause the app to lag, unlike a previous   that relied on a specific message. Although WhatsApp does have a character limit of 6,000 — to prevent messages that the application cannot handle — it seems that this still far too many as a mere 5,000 emojis will kill the app. When talking about the potential exploits of having such a vulnerability, Bhuyan says that an attacker could be sending abusive messages to their victim, blackmailing or threatening them, then send them 5,000 emojis to crash that thread and make it so that the victim can’t access the thread for evidence again. Let’s hope WhatsApp (or Facebook) pushes out a fix for this soon before people with bad intentions catch on and start abusing this."

As we’ve covered stories before about small   or  , we thought it’d be fitting to follow up with a bigger modular device — a TV. Yup,   have come up with a modular TV that can split into several different parts and dance around your wall like something you’d find in a bachelor pad from the future. If you can’t wrap your head around what I’m talking about, take a look at this short clip by Gizmodo: Pretty freaking cool. However, Mashable’s Pete Pachal does note that while all the moving around is cool and stuff, when the screens do come together, he could see the seams between the displays which we found pretty disappointing. Then again this is relatively new tech so there are plenty of kinks to work out. Another TV that Samsung had on display showcased the ability for the TV to change its aspect ratios with the modular technology. The display could rotate two sides of the screen to switch it from a 16:9 aspect ratio to a 4:3 aspect ratio in seconds. This means you can use up all of those valuable pixels for either of the popular aspect ratios, eliminating those annoying black bars. It’s pretty cool but once again Pete noted that the seam was visible. One final modular TV on display, however, showcased what is realistically the closest to a completed product — a massive 170″ wall TV that is made up of several smaller panels. Mashable notes that this is perhaps the most practical use of the modular technology, especially since the seams were not visible. Not only does it allow manufacturers to push the TV’s size to even more ridiculous proportions, Mashable notes that it also makes these monstrous TVs easier to ship because movers can break down a huge set to smaller screens. That’s cool and all but we can think of one more way to utilise these modular panels. Assuming they’re easy to remove and hot swap, parents could easily remove a section of the TV to prevent their kids from watching it when they’re being grounded or during their study sessions. In fact, you could probably remove one panel and bring it along with you on holiday to discourage thieves from nicking your precious television. Then again they’d have to have a pretty sizable moving truck to be able to ship a 170″ television in the first place. Either way, as all modular things usually are, the possibilities are almost endless. What do you guys think of a modular TV? Can you think of any other useful things it can bring to the table that your current TV set can’t? Let us know in the comments below."

Then again nothing is truly invented until   does it right?  
 Based on 9to5Mac’s article, the AirPods looks to be exactly what the name suggests — “air” versions of Apple’s   — completely wireless earbud headphones. Likely bearing a physical resemblance to the Motorola Hint, these new headphones are co-developed with Beats Electronics (which Apple acquired awhile back) and are designed to be compatible with the new   that is rumoured to be ditching the 3.5mm jack altogether. That’s not to say the EarPods will just die off, no, the wired EarPods are expected to be connected via the Lightning connector, a feature that has been included in iOS since 2014. The AirPods on the other hand, are expected to be sold separately as a premium upgrade to the wired in-ear headphones. 9to5Mac also suspects that these earbud headphones will feature a noise-cancelling microphone system for phone  calls and communication with Siri even without Apple’s in-line microphone and remote. It would make sense, after all, they’re supposed to be built for a phone so it wouldn’t make much sense if you couldn’t make calls on them. These AirPods are suspected to come with a carrying case that will charge your wireless headphones when you’re not using them. Without which 9to5Mac estimates the headphones’ battery life at just under 4 hours on a single charge. These AirPods could also be port-less requiring you to charge them in that case. Ditching the 3.5mm jack is nothing new in the mobile phone industry, even Oppo has done it with their uber-thin R5. While Apple’s decision could be driven by the fact that they want to make the iPhone 7 thinner, it could also be because — with all these waterproof iPhone rumours floating about — having a 3.5mm jack would mean another headache when trying to make the device waterproof. When the original iPhone came out right until the iPhone 4s, the headphone jack was located at the top of the device. Since the iPhone 5’s inception, however, the 3.5mm jack has transferred to the bottom, a trend that has carried on even to the iPhone 6s of today. Apple isn’t a stranger to changing things up with their line of products; removing the optical drives from most of their computer devices was one move, changing the headphone jack placements is another. When they made the first move on the iPhone 5, it was because it apparently made more sense to have all your cables sticking out on one end of the device. People were also more inclined to placing their devices head first into their pockets — something I agree with. With their upcoming iPhone 7, Apple is looking to mix things up even more — design wise — with a   and the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack, opting instead to stick with either a Lightning port or a wireless Bluetooth solution. The thing is, wireless devices run on battery, and if you’re already charging your smartphone, smartwatch, laptop, tablet and over-ear headphones, do you really want to charge your earbuds too? The worst part? Having to charge your earbuds are just the tip of the iceberg. At first, Apple locks you within their app ecosystem. Then they don’t allow you to use third-party ports and connectors. Now, they don’t even want you to use third-party headphones, forcing you to stick with their proprietary ones. What about those of us who have bought a solid set of headphones with a 3.5mm jack? Are we forced to use an adapter? Apple has always made some beautiful devices, with gorgeous fit and finishes, but ever since they launched their rendition of a  , we’re a little worried about the new iPhone. Maybe the   was a dud, the ugly apple pie you hide from your guests when they come over for dinner. A lazy oversight. For Apple’s sake, we sure hope so."

You’re not alone! Swiss watchmaker H. Moser & Cie, who are seemingly appalled by the smartwatch fad, have launched what is essentially a mechanical Apple Watch. Remember that one guy saying that the Apple Watch looked like it was  ? Well, this Swiss company just took making fun of the Apple Watch to a whole new level. You might have noticed that Apple’s coveted Watch has finally   to our shores. If you haven’t, what rock have you been living under?! While many see the Apple Watch as a marvelous piece of engineering, these Swiss watchmakers are unimpressed. So much so they told smartwatch users to “get a life” by upgrading to a mechanical watch. Oops, we’d better not show them our   then. Dubbed the Swiss Alp Watch, H. Moser & Cie’s light-hearted jab at Apple comes complete with an Apple-esque product video, complete with rotating close up shots and cheesy “revolutionary” one-line product descriptions. There’s even audio of what sounds like someone taking a bite out of an apple. Kind of reminds us of the time Ikea took a  , complete with the same  . As amusing as this video is, the Swiss Alp Watch is certainly no joke. Besides being a carbon copy of Apple’s smartwatch, the Swiss Alp Watch comes in 18-carat white gold body that has the same dimensions as the Apple Watch. It also has a screw-in non-digital crown adorned with an M, which will power on the device with a single twist. Besides that, the watch has a see-through sapphire crystal rear case that allows you to see the watch in all its beautifully-crafted mechanical glory. As far as features are concerned, the watch (obviously) doesn’t have support for phone calls, heartbeat sensors, text messages or sketching. It does, however, show what H. Moser & Cie calls the “most valuable commodity”: The time. It will “let you reconnect with people by getting out there, meeting your friends and spending time with your loved ones”. All that intricate engineering will cost you, as the watch — which is limited to 50 units — costs a whopping USD24,900 (around RM109,000) which is a touch more than the Apple Watch Edition, which will set you back RM80,000. Okay, maybe more of a smack than a touch. Either way, this video shouldn’t be taken too seriously, as The Verge points out because H. Moser & Cie is by no means a large watchmaker. So it’s more likely that this was made simply to be a tongue-in-cheek joke than anything else. It supposedly represents the company’s “resilience” and their “ferocious desire to fight our values and traditions”, embodying everything they believe in. The important thing is that this is compatible with   device."

While there were some who liked it, everyone in our office was not impressed with their “flagship”. It was a little sluggish and for a device rated so highly on DxOMark, we were quite disappointed with the camera. With a device that left much to be desired and a quiet CES 2016 showing, Sony fans must be hungry for something cool to come out of the tech giant. Well, we don’t have their new flagship for you, but here’s a pretty pink-gold (rose gold? It could just be gold with bad white balance/me being a little colour blind) Sony device. It appears all of Sony’s quietness hasn’t stopped someone from leaking what looks to be the Xperia C6 — sporting a sexy rounded bezel-less design with Sony’s trademark camera-shutter-esque power button. If you’ve been paying attention to futuristic sci-fi movies, you’ll know that bezel-less is the way to go and we were glad Sony are going one step further from the near bezel-less display that appeared on the   from last year. That said, this doesn’t look like a C6 Ultra simply because it looks relatively small in what we’re assuming is the leakster’s hands. Unless of course he/she has gargantuan hands. Either way, if we look at the device’s designs, the good looks we’ve grown accustomed to in a Sony device are all mostly apparent with that thin body and the familiar shape. The edges are rounded like the Xperia C5 Ultra which should make it nicer to hold than the Xperia Z5 though it does seem that the device still has a flat back. There is also a distinct lack of front-facing speakers (aw man) despite all that chin and forehead sony are giving it. What’s a little unnerving is that the back panel of this device seems to be peeling off — which we hope won’t be a problem on the finished product. Sony devices have had pretty good build quality after all. The Xperia C6 is rumoured to sport a 5.5″ full HD display up front, with a 2.0GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor running on the inside. Besides that, there isn’t much information left about the device itself. I guess we’ll have to wait for the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year to (hopefully) find out more.

Rory Lee,This is a 16-lens DSLR killer that can fit in your pocket,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/this-is-a-16-lens-dslr-killer-that-can-fit-in-your-pocket/,"16 lens camera,Android Marshmallow,camera,CES 2016,DSLR,DSLR killer,L16 camera,Light L16,Light L16 camera,Snapdragon 820","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-08,"The problem with getting started on a DSLR is that you have to fork out a tonne of cash to be able to afford a decent body plus a lens. Sure some of you might say that you’re OK with the kit lens, but let’s face it, we all want a red band around our lens. Unless you’re not using a Canon device. A startup called Light is trying to change that with their L16 camera — a camera that has 16 lenses packed into a body small enough to fit in your pocket. Well, sort of. By Mashable’s estimate, the camera is about the size of three iPhone 6 Pluses stacked together. It probably won’t fit in your skinny jeans then. Nevertheless, it is still an impressive feat that they managed to cram that much tech and that many lenses into a body so small. Oh, did we mention it’s powered by a Snapdragon 820 SoC? On the hardware side of things, this camera has 16 (5x35mm, 5x70mm, 6x150mm) different prime lenses that work together to take an image. The camera sets it up in a way that — depending on your zoom and framing — 10 lenses will fire at the same time, taking different quadrants of an image. Note that Mashable says the device has 120mm lenses instead of 150mm lenses, but from the company’s video and several other sites, they say that it uses 150mm lenses. The camera then stitches the 10 images together to form a high 52-megapixel image that is should eliminate quality loss normally experienced at the fringes of a lens. These lenses don’t use any kind of fancy glass, instead, they all use f/2.4 P5 plastic lenses coupled with smartphone camera sensors. Plus, since it uses so many lenses at so many different focal lengths, Light claims that the camera has a near infinite depth of field — something you can adjust in post processing. Sporting a 5″ touchscreen paired with a Snapdragon 820 SoC and an interface based off of Android M, this device looks to bring camera and smartphone imaging technology closer together. Don’t be fooled, this doesn’t have a cellular modem so you can’t make phone calls. A best of both worlds then? We certainly hope so. News of this little guy has been floating around for quite awhile now but recently Mashable got to take a look at one of the prototypes for the device. According to them, the photo stitching on the prototype took a little while to process (it ultimately froze), with the company stating that they’re trying to get the image stitching and processing down to below 1 minute. A pretty ridiculous waiting time for a photo if you ask me. The silver lining is that the processing time is only for the 52-megapixel image, so if you want to post a quick snap on social media, the camera will generate a lower quality image for you. My nose is wrinkling in annoyance. According to Mashable, when Light compared the images between an  , Canon 5D Mark III and the Light L16, they were impressed with how detailed the L16 images were but noted that there was a lot of image noise. Battery life on the other hand, Mashable says that the company ballparks it at about 400 shots. While this is a noble attempt at killing our tried and tested DSLR cameras, it seems like it is still a long way off from actually dealing the final blow. Even if the software is perfected and the device works wonderfully, we (like Mashable) believe that the DSLR will continue to live on and be the primary tool for professional photographers. For events and on-the-go photography though, we can see how this device can be very useful for the professionals thanks to it’s portability and, hopefully, stellar image quality. We will have to see how it stacks up against other compact monsters like the Sony RX100 series before jumping to a conclusion though. That said, if this device works out, it could be a great (and much cheaper, coming in at USD1,699 which is around RM7452) alternative to the DSLR for hobbyists and prosumers. Exciting stuff then!"

The video, while it gives us some insight into what the regular version of the device should look like, it doesn’t have any renders of the variants. Awhile back, there was some discussion on whether the S7 launch in February would see four variants (the S7, S7 Plus, S7 edge and S7 edge Plus) of Samsung’s new flagship. We didn’t think so, but new information has surfaced recently about the possibility of a Galaxy S7 Plus and a Galaxy S7 edge Plus being launched. Popular case manufacturer Spigen has put their Samsung Galaxy S7 cases on sale on   even before the device has been launched, though the cases are not on  . The cases are going from USD14.99 (around RM66). What’s interesting isn’t that the cases are out — because this isn’t the first time Spigen has   — it is that there is a case for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Plus and Galaxy S7 edge Plus. This could very well be confirmation of an earlier @evleaks post about the 4 S7 variants. While we don’t think that Samsung will be launching the S7 Plus and the S7 edge Plus in February, it also doesn’t make sense for Spigen to have the preorder for those cases so soon if Samsung weren’t going to launch their devices until the end of the year. If they do launch four of them at the same time, the devices could either be separated by region, size or even processor. However, if the devices do get separated by region like   and  , we’re sure there will be many unhappy Samsung fans. That said, the images look like placeholder/rendered images because if we were to compare them to @OnLeaks’ (who is quite reputable when it comes to leaks) youtube video, you’d notice that Spigen’s model device is missing the  -esque rear curves. As a recap of the specs. both the S7 and the S7 edge are said to run either their latest Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 depending on the market paired with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. Good news is that that storage is said to be expandable as leaks claim Samsung is   slot that was missing from their 2015 flagships. Camera wise, the Samsungs are said to have a lower megapixel count, at 12MP for the primary, but feature the Korean manufacturer’s latest BRITECELL camera technology that is said to improve low light photography and reduce the camera hump. That coupled with a rumoured f/1.7 aperture lens should see the camera do quite well in low light. The S7 should come in a 5.1″ form-factor while the S7 edge takes on the 5.5″ body.

So they are removing a name but the entity will continue to tinker away under a division of Lenovo. One has to have a sense of humour to appreciate the different stances that took place but for once we think Lenovo and Motorola have finally sorts out their branding issues or so we hope. Back in August,   was what Lenovo decided to do as reported by Android Authority. A slight U-turn of decisions by our records but we guess it’s not easy running a company as large as Lenovo and they’re bound to make some wrong turns along the way. At least following their statements today we can conclude that brand name-wise, Motorola will cease to exist. Subsequently, any new devices under the umbrella will be sold as Moto by Lenovo or Vibe by Lenovo. So the crux of all this is, any future “Moto” device will still very much be built, designed and created by Motorola – e.g. Moto X, Moto G and Moto E – the only different being the company name that sells it. Business will go on, as usual, just the technicalities behind the “names” who sell them will differ. We already saw all of this coming since Q3 of last year but riding the “Motorola” name is really sad to see. In the light of this move, we’re going to take everyone on a trip down memory lane.

The device that aims to reinvent the phone with its 3 in 1 proposition – an iPod, a phone and an Internet communications device. At the same time, Apple had also dropped the word “Computer” from its company name, to better reflect its growing product portfolio that goes beyond Macs.  The move of getting into the phone business was timely. Close to a billion mobile phones was sold in 2006 worldwide. That’s about 5X more than PCs, over 7X the number of MP3 players and 10X more than digital cameras at that time. Steve Jobs was targeting just 1% market share with a goal of selling 10 million iPhones for 2008.  The iPhone was revolutionary back then with its full touch-screen capacitive display with its multi-touch technology. Browsing the web was smooth and there were no cluttered keys or buttons that get in the way. Steve Jobs even mocked the use of a stylus as the iPhone was intuitive enough to be used with your bare fingers. Compared to today’s iPhones, the original model was very barebones. At a time when smartphone makers are moving towards 3G, the iPhone was only a 2G device supporting up to EDGE. There was no AppStore, meaning you’re stuck with its native apps, and the common copy and paste feature was only introduced with iOS 3.0, 2 years later. At the time, many had doubts on the iPhone. The base 4GB model was priced from US$499 (RM1,746 at that time) on a 2-year contract. If you want more storage, the 8GB version was going for US$599 (about RM2096), also on contract. Even Steve Ballmer of Microsoft had a laugh about it and this was a time when Windows Mobile and Nokia Symbian phones reign supreme.  When it was eventually released in 2008, Apple   phones, surpassing its original goal and the rest is history. For Malaysia, the first iPhone to reach here officially was the  . It was priced at RM2,540 for 8GB and RM2,960 for 16GB models.  Until this very day, the iPhone is still considered as the de facto benchmark for the smartphone industry. It changed the way we interact with touch-screen devices and how we consume content and services on a mobile device. However, after Steve Job’s departure, it seems that Apple hasn’t been innovating as much as before, with the competition offering compelling choices at a much competitive price point.  For Steve Baller, he regretted not moving into the hardware business earlier, which saw themselves overtaken by Apple and Samsung.

If they’re bringing such premium materials to their budget Redmi line, that means the bar has been set for their flagship Mi series, starting with the  . Previously leaked press renders hinted that the device would take a rather big turn when it comes to design as it looks to feature a physical button at the front. Now, new images have surfaced on Weibo of the actual device that seems to confirm that suspicion. Besides that, the device also seems to sport metal rails along the side that should lend it a more premium feel in the hand though we’re not entirely sure if the device will have an all-metal unibody though it does seem likely. The speakers look to be placed at the bottom of the device, flanking a charging port. Whether or not that will be USB Type-C port remains to be seen. Since it’s a flagship, the device is no slouch, sporting Qualcomm’s latest quad-core Snapdragon 820 processor with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. There are rumours that there will be another model sporting 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. It is also said to feature a 5.2-inch 1080×1920 pixel display, but there are other rumours that it might be a   (2560×1440) instead. As far as camera optics are concerned, the device is rumoured to have a 16-megapixel rear sensor with a 13-megapixel front camera to boot.

Did you wish it came with a slide/flip/rotate out physical keyboard? Or did you wish that   made a   like they did with their bigger models? Yes? Good news then! One2Touch have introduced the SlimType — an NFC keyboard smartphone cover designed specifically for the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge. Do you want to touch it? Smartphones took the world by storm as people discovered exactly how much they could do on a tiny little device that fit in their pocket. Users began using them for instant messaging, web browsing, social media browsing and media consumption. In fact, people are using them for anything but making a call. However, productivity has been the weakest link in the smartphone’s chain, due to many reasons. First is the fact that with screen real estate that is only the size of your palm, it is quite difficult to view something like a spreadsheet, for instance. Matters are made worse when users have to type because the virtual keyboard usually takes up half the screen. Plus it isn’t very satisfying typing on a virtual keyboard — one reason why   kept the keyboard on the  . With SlimType though, it looks like you can use your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge as a productivity device. There is one major problem that we’ve picked up on, though. Have you seen it yet? Yup, it doesn’t have a kickstand. Most tablet keyboard covers either rely on the device’s built-in kickstand or they fold in some sort of elaborate manner to form a triangular base. On the SlimType though, none of those options appear to be available. We don’t know about you but a kickstand seems mighty useful when you’re trying to be productive. The keyboard doesn’t look like it has much travel or much of a mechanical feel, which makes sense since it’s a phone cover. Doesn’t mean it will be nice to type on, though. Maybe this keyboard can work in a pinch or if you simply hate virtual keyboards and what it does to the size of your screen. Will it truly turn your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge into much more of a productivity beast than it already is? We doubt it. A cool attempt, but alas it doesn’t seem very practical. Although this device, which is on  , currently doesn’t ship directly to Malaysia, there are still ways to get such products into your hands. Google it you lazy people! We’re the type of people who simply must have the best when it comes to productive typing, so maybe we’re being overcritical. What do you guys think? Would you consider dropping USD39.99 (around RM174) on it?"

Now, on Xiaomi’s official Weibo account, the company released an image confirming our suspicions. What’s more, they’ve also included a release date! Beyond that, Xiaomi hasn’t confirmed any of the other specifications but if we’re going off the TENAA entry, the device should have a 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. That 5″ screen should also be a 720p HD screen and the device will likely run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. For camera optics, the Redmi 3 should have a 13MP primary camera paired with a 5MP front camera combo. On paper, this is a significant boost over the Redmi 2, pushing this into the mid-range category. We can only hope that the price will not follow suit. Popular Youtuber MKBHD once said that good phones are getting cheap while cheap phones are getting good and we share that sentiment. This is definitely something that is catching on because it seems that even Xiaomi realised they can’t continue making plasticky budget phones anymore. The only unfortunate thing is that this move to metal will most likely bring a higher price tag, which we’re sure many would frown upon. Keep in mind that this device will probably take a few months to reach our shores. What do you guys think, would you pay more for this Redmi?"

While Touch ‘n Go is gaining momentum in stores, here’s another way to pay without cash. Maybank together with Visa has just announced the PayBand, the first payment wearable in Malaysia. According to Visa, Malaysians are moving towards contactless transactions and they are more likely to shop at a place that accepts one.  How it works is somewhat similar to the Maybank’s  , which is a sticker that you can stick onto your smartphone. Details of Maybank’s Visa PayBand isn’t available on their site, but if it follows the same mechanism, you can make payments up to RM250 without the need of signatures or pin numbers. Think of it as a Touch ‘n Go in a wristband form and it charges directly to your credit card.  In terms of acceptance, it will work with Visa PayWave terminals throughout Malaysia. Just like that PayWave enabled credit card, you would need to wave it in less than 4cm from the terminal to make a payment. This apparently is better than handing over a physical card as there’s no chance for merchants to obtain your full card details. You can learn more about its availability  . The PayBand device isn’t entirely new as   had introduced this in the UK in wristband, keychain fob and sticker format.

The newer Snapdragon 820 processor aims to turn things around while bringing its performance up to the mark.  At CES 2016, Qualcomm had announced China’s LeTV Le Max Pro as the first smartphone to use their SoC. Apart from having top end performance, the Le Max Pro is also the first device to feature Qualcomm’s   and the first to support multi-gigabit 802.11ad WiFi, which is also known as WiGig.   The LeTV Le Max Pro is a large 6.33″ phablet that pushes Quad HD resolution. Under the hood lies a Snapdragon 820 processor with quad Kyro cores at 2.2GHz that’s mated to 4GB of RAM. The processor claims to be more efficient with a 16nm process and it is accompanied by a Adreno 530 GPU. The new processor with quad-cores apparently provides 2X the performance of an Octa-Core based Snapdragon 810 unit.  The Sense ID is supposedly a more advanced biometric feature as it uses ultrasonic sound waves that’s superior than capacitive based scanners commonly used today. Instead of recording an image of your fingertips, Sense ID scans deeper below the skin. As a result, it harder to spoof and it works well even with contaminated fingers. Another advantage is that it works underneath glass, plastics and metal materials, allowing manufacturers to implement the sensor discreetly on smartphones.  In terms of design, it looks like a Huawei/honor device with a familiar antenna band stripes from an iPhone. Strangely there’s still a visible fingerprint scanner at the back which could have been omitted with Sense ID. The rear camera is said to be a 21MP shooter with Optical Image Stabilisation and powering this phablet is a generous 3,400mAh battery.  As seen in the pictures below, it uses USB Type-C for charging and data transfer. Connectivity wise, it also supports Cat 12 4G LTE with download speeds up to 600Mbps and uplink up to 150Mbps. There’s no mention of its availability but you can expect more Snapdragon 820 flagship smartphones to be announced next month during MWC 2016."

When I look around at my friends, more than half of them have more well-defined abs than I do life goals. To fulfill this desire to track health and fitness, tech companies have launched a myriad of fitness bands, trackers and applications designed to keep you as well informed about your body as possible. But while most of those devices existed as individual elements, none were truly unified. At least, that’s what HTC and Under Armour said when they launched their brand new ‘fitness system’ that costs USD400 (around RM1751). You must be thinking, you’d get a lot of gear right? Well, that depends on your definition of ‘a lot’. What we do know is that with the UA HealthBox, you will be receiving three devices — a fitness band, a smart scale and a heart-rate monitor. Dubbed the UA Band, this fitness band is designed to be worn all-day every day because it tracks daily activities, workout and sleep. Under the band’s “seamless exterior shell” is a display which is “discreetly hidden” allowing it to disappear when not in use. While we don’t know how hidden they wanted the screen to be, from the pictures (even their product shots) it certainly looks like it’s well hidden enough to be a nightmare to view under sunlight. The UA Band also features an advanced workout mode with a display that stays on during the workout as well as an LED that indicates heart rate zone when paired with the heart rate monitor. Wow, a screen that stays on! Next, we have the UA Heart Rate — a compact heart rate monitor that is designed to be undetectable during workouts. It is also supposed to help individuals monitor intensity and train smarter while providing an accurate calculation of calories burned. How refreshing, a heart rate monitor that actually does all this accurately! Finally, we have the UA Scale. It’s a smart scale that is “beautifully crafted” and WiFi enabled in an “iconic circular design”. This scale also has a hidden LED display that makes the technology invisible when not in use. It also looks like there is a “nifty” feature where they show you a bunch of logos, greet you and only after they’ve done all that do they show you your weight. Perfect for when you’re in a hurry! According to them, these three devices are perfectly synced to provide the user with a “customised experience”, but they fail to mention exactly what that customised experience is. Based on the video, it looks like it’s just a personalised profile on your “dashboard” in the UA Record app. Speaking of the app, UA and HTC have made it available in both the   and   as a free download. The application shows you the results of your daily health and fitness tracking plus a “How do you feel?” scale. That said, there is some benefit to having all of these devices connected. Like they highlighted in their video, there is a lot of potential for growth into an actual ecosystem (via smart shoes, headphones, etc.). Plus there is the benefit of it being simple to use and understand. For now though, this “system” seems more like your paying a lot for a brand to be plastered onto existing technology and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, look at Beats by Dre, they’re selling like hot cakes."

Well, there has been a new development in the matter as TM have decided to postpone their defaulting to the e-Bill format by six months. Towards the end of last year, TM broadband subscribers (Streamyx and UniFi) exploded in outrage when they found out that TM was planning to charge them an exorbitant amount for their printed bills. The ISP justified their actions by claiming that it was part of their move to go green — cutting down and eliminating the usage of paper. As a form of ‘motivation’ to get customers to switch to e-Billing, the telecommunications company was going to incur a monthly charge of RM2 for those who still want to receive their bill in paper format. Charge Malaysians extra for anything and you know outrage will soon follow. In any case, TM issued an explanation that ended up giving consumers more confusion than confirmation because while they announced that it was an RM2 surcharge on their website, a surcharge of RM5 was mentioned on the printed bills. Now, there is finally a very official document detailing TM’s plans. According to the release, TM is postponing the defaulting of billing to the e-billing system to 1 July 2016 — seven months after the original intended implementation date of January 2016. This means that customers can still continue to receive their printed bill for now, but are strongly encouraged to make the switch as soon as possible. Customers who fail to make the switch by 1 July 2016 will continue to receive their printed bill but be incurred a surcharge of RM2 per month. TM is calling on all their subscribers to make the switch as soon as possible if they don’t want to be forced to pay more. They highlight that there are many benefits to using the e-billing system, from speed (customers can receive their bills within 4 days) to SMS alerts and even the ability to check your bill online (up to 6 months) from anywhere at any time by simply logging on to this  . To do so, simply update your preferred email address and mobile number by sending an email to help@tm.com.my or visit the nearest TMpoint outlet, or call TM Contact Centre at 100 from your landline. According to TM, over 700,000 out of more than 4.4 million TM residential customers are already on the e-Bill statements. That’s only about 16% of the user base. Do note that this does not affect people who are only subscribed to TM’s telephone services (without broadband). These customers will receive the printed bill for free."

Rory Lee,ASUS Zenfone Zoom to be launched in Malaysia next week,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/06/asus-zenfone-zoom-to-be-launched-in-malaysia-next-week/,"Android,ASUS ZenFone Zoom,ASUS ZenFone Zoom Malaysia,ASUS Zenfone Zoom Malaysia launch,ASUS Zenfone Zoom official,ASUS Zenfone Zoom official malaysia,smart phone,smartphone,Zenfone Zoom Malaysia launch,Zenfone Zoom official malaysia","Android,Asus,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-06,"If you’ve coveted  ‘s   ever since you saw it first announced way back in early 2015, it looks like you’re in luck, because look what we got in the mail today. Recently released in Taiwan, the ASUS Zenfone Zoom is a pretty interesting device. While smartphone cameras have gotten better with each iteration, one of their flaws have always been a lack of optical zoom. This was because adding an optical zoom would cause your device to be much thicker than a regular smartphone — a compromise device manufacturers were not willing to make. So, unless one was willing to manually zoom with one’s feet, smartphone photographers often had to settle for a grainier picture if they wanted to zoom. With the Zenfone Zoom, however, ASUS is claiming that this is the thinnest 3x optical zoom smartphone…in the world. They accomplished this by mounting the smartphone camera’s dual periscope horizontally across the back of the device. As a result, it boasts a 5mm “ultra-thin edge” thanks to an ergonomic curve that looks a lot like ASUS’s other Zenfones. The primary camera itself, while only sporting 13-megapixels, comes with optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus, a dual-tone LED flash and a SmartFSI Panasonic sensor. To make up for the lack in resolution, ASUS has implemented a Super Resolution function that fuses four shots into one picture for greater clarity (up to 52MP). It also has ASUS’s PixelMaster 2.0 — a feature famed for its low-light performance. To facilitate the impressive camera specifications, the Zenfone Zoom will have not only have a dedicated shutter button, it also has a dedicated video button. It’s no slouch when it comes to performance either, sporting a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom CPU paired with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB/128GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD). The phone will come running Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box with ASUS’s ZenUI skin on top. At the front, this camera-centric smartphone features a 5.5″ full-HD display tucked under Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4. It also has a metal finish along the rails of the phone to give it a more premium feel. Around the back, there seems to be some differences compared to the one  , as that one had some kind of textured back (faux leather perhaps?). However, this could be because the images in the Malaysian site are outdated. If you head on over to the   you can see that the build more closely resembles the one released in Taiwan. Nevertheless, we will find out how it looks like in about a week’s time. The Zenfone Zoom will sport a 3,000 mAh capacity battery, paired with ASUS’s BoostMaster technology. It is supposed to give you a 60% charge in 39 minutes. Although the Zenfone Zoom has support for up to 802.11ac WiFi, it only has one micro-SIM slot for mobile connectivity. In the US, the Zenfone Zoom comes in at around USD399, which translates to about RM1,760. Considering the state of the ringgit, an optimistic estimate of the Zenfone Zoom’s price here in Malaysia would be RM1,799, but realistically we should probably see it closer to RM1,899. While we’re pretty stoked about the device, we want to know what you guys think. Let us know in the comments below. Stay tuned for our coverage of the official release."

Rory Lee,The ASUS Reco Smart camera is more than just a dash-cam,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/06/the-asus-reco-smart-camera-is-more-than-just-a-dash-cam/,"ASUS dash camera,ASUS portable camera,ASUS Reco Smart camera,ASUS Reco Smart Camera launch,CES 2016,Reco Smart,Reco Smart camera","Asus,Mobile Accessories",2016-01-06,"just dropped a video for their new Reco Smart camera that is designed to not only work as a dash cam but also as a portable camera.  With a fast lens, Sony sensor and an interesting design, things are looking pretty good for it. The Reco Smart camera is shaped a lot like a regular camera lens, without the body, which means that it is also quite large, much like  ‘s QX Camera. With that extra real estate though, ASUS can fit a large (and fast) f/1.8 aperture lens which should let it perform well in low-light conditions. ASUS’s camera also has a ‘Parking monitor mode’ that lets the camera detect movement in front of your vehicle and automatically start recording until it detects no further movement for one minute. Coupled with a 150-degree wide-angle lens, this Reco Smart cam is shaping up to be a pretty good dash-cam. In the event of a collision, the built-in three-axis G-sensor triggers the emergency record function. It will then save the recording to the ASUS WebStorage cloud and lock it down so it won’t be deleted by accident. Besides that, the camera can also be programmed to send out an emergency text message to a designated contact. Although there is no mention of the sensor’s megapixel count, the camera supports full-HD 1080p video recording as well as real-time previews and downloads on smart devices via the Reco app. Pairing with your smart device should also be a breeze with NFC One Touch Engage. As the device is WiFi capable (802.11 b/g/n), you also get 500GB of ASUS WebStorage cloud storage for free for one year. When ASUS said that the device could also function as a portable camera, they weren’t kidding because from the looks of things, the Reco Camera is compatible with a wide range of standard camera accessories. Stuff like tripods, monopods and even lens filters (which work with 58mm diameter lenses) should fit with no problems. The only bummer is that the device comes with a tiny 720mAh battery that can only support up to one hour of 1080p video recording with the WiFi turned on. As a comparison, a   Hero4 usually averages 1.5 hours of battery life at 1080p recording. You do get a decent amount of kit in the package though, including a microSD card, car charger, dual USB car charger, GPS mount holder and more. A waterproof housing for the camera is also available for purchase. For now, there is no information on availability or pricing."

Priced from RM1,599. One of the biggest thorns in our smartwatch sides has been the fact that   has yet to bring it’s coveted smartwatch, the  , to our shores. Well, the wait is almost up because Apple is set to put two exclusive Apple Watch Sport designs on sale in Malaysia on February 8. To commemorate the Chinese New Year celebrations, Apple looks to be putting these two “special” models on sale in China, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. This comes after an announcement message appeared briefly on the countries’ corresponding Apple websites before being removed earlier today. The announcement read: 9to5Mac also reports that while the “Buy Now” and “Shop Now” links appeared for a short time on Apple’s website, it looks like the company might have launched the announcement a bit prematurely. It is currently unclear how Apple plans to sell these devices, or if they will be priced at an equally “special” price from the normal Apple Watch Sport models. While Apple officially launched the Watch way back in 2014, the final release of the product was in April the following year. Since then, the availability of the device has slowly trickled into our neighbouring countries. Now it seems our time may be near, though at this point it is still a rumour because there is no official confirmation. That said, this information was sourced from 9to5Mac and MacRumours, both of whom are usually right when it comes to stuff like these. If this launch date holds true, this would mean that Malaysia is one of the last markets to get the Apple Watch — almost an entire year after it was officially released. To make matters worse, this sale is only available until February 22 while supplies last. If you’d like to brush up on the Apple Watch and all of its glory before you decide to purchase one, head on over to our   of the smartwatch."

Alongside several interesting features, Lenovo will also be bundling its midrange device with a virtual reality (VR) headset. The Vibe K4 Note’s specifications look good on paper, with it sporting a 5.5-inch full-HD (1920×1080 pixels) IPS panel, which results in a pixel density of 401ppi. The display, which the company claims has a 1000:1 contrast ratio with adjustable colour balance, will be tucked under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 3. On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6753 SoC paired with 3GB of DDR3 RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. For optics, the device will see a 13MP rear shooter with PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus) and a fast f/2.2 aperture. Helping the device out with low-light shots is a two-tone LED flash to the right of the camera module. For selfies, the phone unsurprisingly sports a 5MP front-facing camera. What is surprising is the fact that the device will feature a pair of front-facing stereo Dolby Atmos speakers, something that’s missing even on most flagship devices. What’s more, this mid-range device also sports a fingerprint scanner mounted at the back just below the primary camera (my personal favourite location), something that is still relatively rare at this end of the market. Powering everything will be a quick charge enabled 3,300 mAh battery that is supposed to deliver 265 hours of 3G standby time and 22 hours of 3G talk time. The device also comes with dual-SIM support, both of which have support for 4G LTE. The device will run Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Lenovo’s Vibe UI skin on top, though we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update in the near future. The reason they bundled the smartphone with a VR headset is so that users can take advantage of Lenovo’s TheaterMax technology which converts regular content into immersive VR content. While we don’t know how “immersive” TheaterMax will end up being, Lenovo seems pretty confident in it, leaving the final judgement to time itself. Lenovo’s mid-ranger will go on a flash sale on Amazon India on January 19 at INR11,999 (around RM783) for just the device, while the VR bundle will cost INR13,299 (around RM868). Note that for the first few flash sales, the device will only be sold in the VR bundle, but priced at a discounted INR12,499 (around RM816). No information on whether this device will make it to Malaysia is present at the time of this article’s writing. It is important to point out that the predecessor, the Note K3, is   at RM599."

The Galaxy TabPro S will come with a choice of either a Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro operating system, so there is no option for an Android OS of any kind. Up front, the tablet will have a 12-inch FHD+ (2160×1440 pixels) sAMOLED display — the first Windows 10 tablet to have a Super AMOLED screen. On the inside, this massive tablet will be powered by a dual-core Intel Core M processor, clocked at 2.2GHz. paired with 4GB of RAM and either a 128GB or 256GB SSD. Because the device is powered by a Core M processor, it has a fanless design which eliminates that annoying whirring sound. We initially thought that this device would be competition for the  , but with these specs (of course depending on the price) it looks to be able to take on even the low spec   with a Core M3 processor. Do note that Samsung did not mention which Core M processor they’re using, only that it is a 6th-gen one. The device will also support 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac MIMO, WiFi Direct, NFC and Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity. For those on the move, there’s also a 4G LTE (Cat.6) version alongside a WiFi only version. GPS and GLONASS are also supported. For optics, the Galaxy TabPro S will have a 5MP front and rear camera, which isn’t impressive but you don’t want to be that guy taking pictures with your 12″ tablet do you? For video, the cameras will support recording up to an FHD resolution (1920×1080). Powering the components will be a 5,200 mAh battery that Samsung says can last up to 10 hours, and because the tablet sports a USB Type-C port, it will also have fast charging allowing you to top the device up in about 2.5 hours. Since 2-in-1 devices are all the rage right now, the Galaxy TabPro S will come with a keyboard (not sold separately) that looks very much like the old   Type Cover. Unlike the  , this keyboard can actually function as a cover because it adopts a more old-school approach to keyboard attachment. Also, note that it has a touchpad, something that is missing from both  ‘s   and  . For users who want a stylus or more ports, Samsung is offering a Bluetooth Pen and a multi-port adapter (HDMI, USB Type A & C) but are sold separately. Samsung says that the Galaxy TabPro S will be available globally come February 2016 though there is no mention of a recommended retail price."

You probably wake up, brush your teeth, take a dump, shower, change and head down for a cup of your favourite wake-me-up drink while you catch up on your social media feed —  , for instance. Unless you’re me, then that all changes depending on how many times I hit the snooze button. Facebook could probably be your favourite social media platform. Heck, you’re probably reading this article because it popped up on your Facebook feed. Now, what if I told you that your favourite social media platform was secretly experimenting on you? According to a report by The Verge, it appears that Facebook had secretly experimented on its Android mobile users, crashing their apps intentionally, “selectively disconnecting” them from their Facebook applications for hours on end. Why? Well, apparently it was done to prepare for the possibility of     for competitive reasons. They wanted to prepare for a future where users might have to resort to downloading the Facebook application from a source outside of the Google  . Despite the fact that Facebook is one of the Play Store’s biggest application developers, there is a looming threat that the social network could bypass Google’s services altogether. The tests were allegedly conducted to see how far they could go to get Android users to abandon their platform altogether. The results? “People never stopped coming back.” According to a person familiar with the tests, those who were locked out of their application defaulted to the mobile web browser version of Facebook, rather than abandoning the application. Are you surprised? We weren’t. Right now, there is simply no alternative to Facebook and what the social media platform offers, so it seems only natural that users would find any means possible to access the site. The only problem this presents is that like all tyrants, once people give Facebook this “absolute power”, the social media giant can afford to push more boundaries than otherwise ethically possible because they know you will always come back. The only problem this presents is that like all tyrants, once people give Facebook this “absolute power”, the social media giant can afford to push more boundaries than otherwise ethically possible because they know you will always come back. Although this was supposedly a one-time experiment conducted years ago, this isn’t the first social experiment Facebook undertook. Yes, we’re talking about the controversy in 2014 where Facebook altered the content on users’ News Feeds to see if it would change their moods. Information surfaced last year that Facebook bombarded several users’ News Feeds with sad and depressing content to see if they were less likely to visit the site if it made them sad. The experiment was so controversial that even the editor behind the study was “ “, questioning if the results of the study were actually worth all the backlash. What most people don’t realise — or choose to turn a blind eye on — is that social experimenting on the Internet is nothing new. Pretty much every website has done it to some extent. The question then becomes whether you know you’re being experimented on or not. Perhaps what makes what Facebook did so painful was that it felt personal on some level because these were people’s personal feeds. Privacy settings exist for a reason right?

Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S7 will get features you wanted so badly on the S6,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/05/samsung-galaxy-s7-micro-sd-waterproof-larger-battery/,"Android,battery capacity,microSD,microSD Slot,MWC 2016,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 Battery,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 Specs,Samsung Galaxy S7 Waterproof,Waterproof","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-01-05,"The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge had opened a new chapter for Samsung with its premium glass and metal design, along with top specs that hold well to this very day. Of course, there are many that frown upon its compromises. It was their first flagship to not have a removable battery and most critical of all, it lacks an expandable microSD slot. If you were disappointed by the Galaxy S6, there’s a lot to look forward to on the upcoming model. According to @evleaks, the new Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will finally offer a microSD slot. Like the current S6, both models will be offered with either 32GB and 64GB storage options, which in Malaysia we are likely to receive the smallest option of just 32GB. This would be good news for those taking loads of pictures and 4K videos as the device is alleged to support microSD cards up to 200GB. This reaffirms an earlier “ ” that Samsung is finally bringing back the microSD slot to its latest flagship. With each new model, the Galaxy S lineup has always seen an increase of battery capacities. However on the Galaxy S6, it was downsized from 2,800mAh on the Galaxy S5 to just 2,550mAh (2,600mAh on the S6 edge). Fortunately, the new processor and energy efficient   were good at maximising every mAh of power. The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are alleged to receive 3,000mAh and 3,600mAh capacity batteries respectively, which is a huge jump. That’s like fitting a Galaxy Note battery into a smaller device, and hopefully this could translate to more than 24 hours of usage. Wireless Charging will still be the star of the show and Samsung will likely to support fast wireless charging for the new flagship duo as it did with the Galaxy Note5. Charging an S7 is reported to take about 2 hours wirelessly while the S7 edge will take slightly longer at 2.2 hours. First introduced on the Galaxy S5, the S7 is said to be getting water and dust resistance with an IP67 rating. This is similar with the Galaxy S5 which in theory can be submerged up to 1 metre for up to 30 minutes. Even if you don’t go to the pool, having water resistance is a good feature to have especially for those unexpected moments. Even word has it that the folks at Cupertino   to make its upcoming iPhone waterproof. If Samsung is doing it, it better be a cap-less design without those clumsy flap covers. The Galaxy S7/S7 edge will be running on their latest Exynos 8890 processor but there will be a Qualcomm-powered version for selected markets that runs on a Snapdragon 820 processor. Expect them to come with 4GB of RAM and has support for faster Cat 9 4G LTE. In terms of screen size, the standard S7 is likely to retain the same compact 5.1″ Quad HD display while the S7 edge is rumoured to be either a larger 5.5 or 5.7 incher. To have a 5.7″ smartphone at this time of the year   as it would cannibalise its own S6 edge+ that was launched not too long ago. Camera wise, the new flagships will get a smaller pixel count of 12MP instead of its current 16MP shooter. However, it is compensated with faster f/1.7 lens versus f/1.9 for better low-light performance. With a smaller BRITECELL camera module, the new S7 could have a flat and flush back design without the protruding camera hump. Are you excited now? MWC 2016 is happening on 22nd February 2016 and Samsung would normally announce their latest Galaxy S model a day earlier."

First up is a glorious fixed-wing UAV from Parrot, the very same people who brought you the Bebop 2 — a powerful little quadcopter drone that is allegedly windproof up to 40mph (that’s about 64 kph). With the Disco, Parrot are looking to shake their lineup up with this foam-plastic fixed-wing drone that has automated takeoff and landing. That means you can just toss it in the air and the drone will start flying though it does need a little bit of room to get it climbing. The Disco, with it’s single propeller and detachable wings, can hit speeds of up to 50mph (around 80kph) and stay flying for about 45 minutes on a single charge. There is also an ultrasound camera mounted at the bottom of the drone that helps it land autonomously. Well, more like crash autonomously if we’re looking at the teaser footage. Like the Bebop 2, you can control the Disco with Parrot’s Skycontroller or plot a flight plan and have the drone do the flying itself. The drone also has a “return home” function that does exactly what the name suggests. Mounted at the front is the same eye-like 14-megapixel fisheye lens camera Parrot mounts on the Bebop 2, so it will likely feature the same digital panning and stability options as well. While ditching the quadcopter design lets you fly more realistically (especially with FPV goggles), there will inevitably be drawbacks. The drone, for example, loses its ability to hover and takeoff vertically, making it less ideal for filming. It will also inevitably be less stable and manoeuvrable than a quadcopter. Upside? Y0u can fly, turn and pitch like an actual plane. COOL. Despite their claims, The Verge points out that Parrot aren’t the first to introduce a ready-to-fly fixed-wing drone as there are already several small fixed-wing drones in the market. Though we do think the Disco is one of the best looking fixed-wing drones out there. Or almost out there, since it’s still a prototype. Parrot does plan to make this available to consumers within this year so that’s something to look forward to."

This year, the participating parties are offering a USD100,000 (RM434,000) grand prize to the team that can build the best application for launching a drone from a moving vehicle as part of a search-and-rescue mission. Although we’ve seen drones being launched for rescue missions in the past, none of them have been launched from a car in motion. This is an issue because the conditions of a disaster are never the same, often needing the rescue team to stay on the move to avoid getting caught up in it themselves. So, the participants are tasked with launching and landing a drone from the bed of a Ford F-150 pickup truck. Here’s the full timeline of the DJI SDK Developer Challenge: In certain parts of the world, drones bring about more fear than anything else, though it’s amazing to see that there are (obvious) pros in utilising them for aid drop-offs and search-and-rescue missions; lessening the risk of rescuers by putting drones out there instead. And let’s not forget the use of these drones by photojournalist worldwide, capturing civil unrest in states observing media lockdowns. Besides holding competitions to save the world, DJI has also updated their existing Phantom and Inspire drone series. While DJI’s uber cool Inspire 1 gets a minor colour update (it now comes in black), they’ve added a 4K camera to the Phantom 3, a feature only available on the Phantom 3 Professional in the past."

People simply spend too much time on it, causing them to ignore their loved ones, peers and — like this woman found out the hard way — can even lead to death.   Wang, a 28-year-old woman from Wenzhou, located in China’s Zhejiang province fell into a river and drowned after she missed her step because she was too preoccupied with her phone. Wang, who was a migrant worker and mother of two was walking in the middle of the road before the incident. However, as she was too preoccupied with her device, she didn’t notice when she gradually began walking towards the edge of the water. Online surveillance footage shows Wang struggling for over a minute before she disappeared from the surface of the water. Her body was discovered after her husband Yang spotted her shoe floating on the river when he went looking for her the next morning. Although the river was only chest-deep, the sludge at the riverbed can cause people to slip and fall. This incident has served as a wake-up call to the Chinese public as netizens took to the social media, calling for people to exercise caution when using phones. We’d like to say that this is the first tragedy caused by phubbing (snubbing someone in favour of your smartphone), but that just isn’t the case. It used to be “don’t drive and text”, now it needs to also be “don’t walk and use your phone”. You might think, “oh that’s not me, I only use it at the dinner table!”. What people don’t realise is that everything starts somewhere. Using them initially to avoid socially awkward situations can often lead to a reliance on the device and we all know where that leads. An Ohio State University researcher discovered that the number of pedestrian deaths has dramatically increased over the past few years and many of which were caused by telephone distractions.

 The thing that makes the idea of a modular device, be it a smartphone,  , or, in this case, a smartcase, so brilliant is that it is completely customisable. For the first time the users themselves can decide exactly what they want or don’t want to have on their device. Fancy a good camera? Get a powerful camera module. Need more juice to last you an entire day? Get a battery module. Want a chainsaw to go jungle trekking? Get a…err well, I don’t think there’s a module for that yet but I’m sure you can see my point. Initially, people thought that a modular smartphone was the way to go, so companies like   poured their resources into developing a modular smartphone, but it obviously that    . Then, along came the people who founded nexpaq, a small group of talented individuals who wanted to bring the modular concept into the world on a much smaller scale:  . It’s something everyone uses, it’s something almost everyone needs and — perhaps most importantly — something far more accessible to the general public. Despite claiming to be cheaper than the smartphones we know and readily purchase today, purchasing a modular smartphone was always going to be a big investment. However, with a case like nexpaq’s, a   that includes a case and four modules would only set you back USD169 (around RM728). The best part? The folks at nexpaq are enlisting the help of the community to develop their modular smartphone case, releasing developer kits for both the modules and its accompanying software. Now, more are following suit, with the latest one coming from a company called i-Blades who have put up their version of the modular smartphone case, the i-Blades Smartcase. The i-Blades Smartcase is currently on Indiegogo looking for funding and the best part about it is that their modules can apparently stack infinitely. Your device would look like it has one of Apple’s  Cases though, but I digress. If you’re interested, head on over to their   and check it out. I really do believe that modular devices are the future. I don’t want some guy I don’t know in a lab coat in some factory in the middle of China deciding what I should and shouldn’t have on my smartphone. I want that power. It’s my phone after all. That said, I don’t think we’re quite ready for the modular smartphone just yet, but a modular smartphone case? I wouldn’t mind me some of that. Baby steps, right?"

You might see Samsung expanding its range of flexible display devices, and it’s not the first time they stuffed a projector into a smartphone (remember the  ?).

While there have been rumours going around about a potential Samsung Galaxy S7+, SamMobile believes that this will likely be the S7 edge instead. We highly doubt Samsung would cannibalise their popular recent flagship and risk their consumers getting pissed at them, just so they can be “radical”. It’s very unlikely that they would  . Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, the picture also reveals another interesting specification: The camera module. According to the picture, the S7 (or S7 edge or S7+) looks to feature a 12.2-megapixel rear camera coupled with a 5-megapixel front shooter. What’s interesting is the drastic drop in megapixel count for the rear camera, down from 16MP, in a 2016 device. This is in-line with an earlier rumour that the device would sport a 12MP large pixel sensor, though it doesn’t match Samsung’s  . At their Investor’s Forum last year, Samsung unveiled the BRITECELL camera technology, which utilises tiny one micron pixels which are “the smallest pixel for slim smartphone”. If Samsung were to use these small pixels and also drop pixel count, then they would really have to have something up their sleeve to help the sensor cope with low-light photography. The image also reveals that the device will have a Snapdragon 820 processor with an Adreno 530 GPU mated with 4GB of RAM, which is, unsurprising. In any case, these are only rumours and Samsung could just be pulling a fast one, using multiple prototypes to mislead leaksters. Although you should probably take this with a grain of salt, this does give us a lot to be excited about for 2016’s smartphones."

Alexander Wong,This might be the best alternative to KLIA Express,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/30/here-is-a-cheaper-way-to-go-to-klia/,"Car Sharing,Comos,electric car,KLIA,KLIA Express,KLIA Express Alternative,Renault Zoe,Ride Sharing,Uber,Uber Malaysia","Cool stuff,Others",2015-12-30,"If you’re a frequent traveler,   is the best way to get to Kuala Lumpur International Airport in under 30 minutes. With everything going up, the fares will be   to RM55/way effective 1st January 2016. That’s a hefty RM110 for two people heading to the airport.  Is there a cheaper alternative? What if we tell you there’s another way of getting there with zero emission and it costs less than an   ride? COMOS, a ride-sharing provider that uses 100% electric vehicles has introduced an Airport Valet Service. For a flat rate of RM70, you can head to KLIA or KLIA2 in an electric-powered  . The service comes with a designated COMOS staff, so you can hop-on and hop-off without worrying about parking. Do note that the Renault Zoe is a compact hatchback, so the boot isn’t as spacious as a typical sedan car.  The COMOS Airport Valet service would cost you RM70 which is inclusive of GST, toll and delivery charges to your location. So that equates to RM35/person for a trip for two or RM23.34/person for 3 pax. On the downside, it is only available from 9:00AM to 4:00PM, and it covers just the following areas in the Klang Valley.  If you haven’t tried COMOS before, the first step of getting a key card would take a while. You would need to   for a membership which now costs RM50 for 1 year (Normal: RM300). Once that’s done, you can collect your COMOS card and start booking as follows: You are advised to request the service at least 2 hours ahead of the intended time and it is subject to actual availability of cars. You may book for the next day but the option is only available after 10:00PM. This is a cashless service and the final amount will be charged to your registered credit card. You can read up more about the service  . COMOS was introduced as an alternative means to car ownership. Being a ride-sharing service, you only pay for membership and usage fees according to your usage. At the moment, the rental costs RM6 for 15 minutes with a minimum booking of 30 minutes (RM12). For an all day usage, it will cost you a flat rate of RM144.  With its fleet of electric cars, there’s no fuel cost involved so you won’t need to return the car with a full tank. There are several COMOS pick up stations located around PJ and KL with more being planned out in the near future. Currently all bookings are done via its website on   and soon they will be releasing a mobile app for iOS and Android. We’ve tried COMOS a couple of times and it is quite an experience driving a quiet vehicle that hums like a spaceship. Since it’s new, the number of stations with charging points are quite limited. It isn’t really that cost efficient for simple point to point trips since you’re required to return the vehicle to its limited pickup/drop off points.  If you’re making a stop, you would still need to pay for parking, which defeats the purpose of saving time and money. This would probably make more sense once they have more stations around strategic points including shopping malls and office complexes.  If COMOS isn’t viable due to timing and location, Uber is   a flat rate of RM75 (excluding tolls) to KLIA/KLIA2. There’s no promo code required, and you can request anytime from now until 5th January 2016. Uber is available on  ,   and  . If you’re traveling alone, KLIA Express is still the cheaper option overall. Despite the RM55/way announcement, there are additional discounts if you book return tickets and purchasing them online or using specific credit cards. At the moment,   are entitled to a 20% discount. A return KLIA Express ticket cost RM100 and it will cost you just RM80 which is equivalent to RM40 per way.

A tree, nothing, without its roots. A product, nothing, without its consumers. So what happens when a smartphone manufacturer gets slapped with a class action lawsuit filed by the very people who used to preach their excellence? Draaaama! More than a hundred infuriated   owners have filed a lawsuit against  , claiming USD5 million (around RM21.5 million) in damages, accusing them of significantly slowing down their devices with the new   9 update. The lawsuit was filed with a New York district court, though no hearings have been set at this time. According to plaintiff Chiam Lerman and several others, the new update slowed the device down so much that it interfered with day-to-day usage. It seems that after upgrading, both first and third-party applications exhibited delayed launch times, slow response to touchscreen input and other problems. Overall performance was also affected by freezes and crash events. They also accuse Apple of engaging in deceptive trade practices and false advertising by proclaiming that the update is compatible with legacy smartphones dating back to the iPhone 4s models. The lawsuit also claims that Apple were well aware of iOS 9’s negative impacts on the iPhone 4s but went ahead with the marketing campaign anyway. The campaign advertised faster performance, enhanced security, longer battery life among other enticing features. To make matters worse, the company’s advertisements, website, and iOS page did not have any warning of potential compatibility issues for older devices. Apparently the complaint went after Apple’s iOS system itself, because when faced with a sluggish and slow device, it is more likely that the average Apple user would upgrade to a new iOS product instead of branching out. The reason being that transferring information across devices within the same ecosystem is much easier. Plus there is also the familiarity factor. It isn’t too surprising that a new iOS update would slow down older devices because each new update is designed to take advantage of the hardware from the recent models. This includes a host of new features and improvements that an older device may not have even dreamt was possible, much less have support for it. Apple has been in this situation before, back in 2011, where plaintiffs complained that iOS 4 turned their iPhone 3G into “iBricks”. That case was tossed out a year later and it seems likely that this lawsuit will suffer the same fate. One of the main arguments in the iOS vs Android war was that Apple always pushed new updates, even to old devices such as the iPhone 4s while Android devices have a realistic lifespan of 2 years. After 2 years, it is very unlikely that your Android device would be getting any updates from its manufacturer. Apple fans argued that this was because Android was so fragmented, with so many different manufacturers making so many different versions of the Android OS. iOS isn’t the same because everything was unified under one banner. That said, there is an exception to this   dilemma: The   devices. Nexus smartphones tend to receive OS updates much quicker and for longer than most other devices. But unlike what’s happening to these unfortunate iPhone 4s users, each Android update usually improves the performance of older devices due to improved optimisation of the OS. This brings Apple users to what looks like a difficult decision. Do you update your OS to get new features and better security at the risk of sluggish performance? Or do you stick to what already works and brave potential security risks? Let us know in the comments below. If you’re as frustrated as these users and think Apple does this on purpose so that people will be forced to buy a new iPhone, don’t hesitate to drop your opinion in the comment box too!"

If you’ve been envying our neighbours in Indonesia, who are paying nearly half of what we pay for 1GB of data, we feel you too. But, if you’re thinking of creating a blog to hate on our mobile carriers, citing examples of how much cheaper data is in our neighbouring countries, you might want to reconsider. This is because based on data collected by website  , we actually have more affordable data — on average, per 1GB — than most countries in Southeast Asia. In their study, Tech In Asia compiled data from all the Southeast Asian countries and calculated what the typical price of 1GB (in USD) of data was. Then, they looked up the minimum wage of each country, (picking the typical wage of a low-income worker in Brunei, Singapore and Cambodia because they didn’t have an official minimum wage) comparing it with the respective data costs. Finally, they used that data to estimate how many hours a worker would have to work to be able to afford 1GB of data and arranged the countries according to scale in a nifty infographic. The results of their study are as follows: From the data, Malaysia is actually doing quite well, finishing within the top 5 of all the countries in SEA for the most affordable data, despite the fact that we’re paying nearly USD1.60 (RM6.88) more than Indonesia and almost USD1 (RM4.30) higher than Vietnam and Myanmar for 1GB of data. Thanks to our higher minimum wage, a Malaysian minimum wage worker would only have to put in 3 hours and 45 minutes of hard work to enjoy 1GB of data. We’re still far off from Brunei though, who leads the pack at only 1 hour and 4 minutes of work needed for 1GB of data, despite their data costing USD2.67 (RM11.48) more than Malaysia. The power of a higher income nation eh? Another interesting bit of information is how incredibly low the price of mobile data in Cambodia is, coming in at a cool USD1.50/GB (RM6.45), sliding them into third place right behind Singapore despite their minimum wage being only USD0.66 (RM2.84) per hour. There is only one cause for concern: The accuracy of this data. Let’s take Malaysia for example. Based on the infographic, we average USD4.42 per 1GB of data, which is roughly equivalent to RM19/GB. Are our plans that expensive? Let’s take a look at the current prepaid data plans being offered by our Telcos: 
 Across these 18 different plans, the average (mean) cost of 1GB of data in Malaysia is RM18.68, which is pretty close to the average in the data set. Keep in mind the lower average value is likely because of the promotions that are currently active. Hashtag legit information (as far as Malaysia is concerned anyway). It’s no secret that we’ve arrived at an era where everyone is obsessed with staying connected. In the past, only moderately large F&B chains offer free WiFi to their customers, but now even mamak shops have “FREE WIFI” signs pasted in and around their establishment. Why? Well, smartphones are getting more and more accessible for the masses and we all know that unless we keep our phones connected to the Internet, they’re little more than 180g bricks. But, we can’t always rely on WiFi to stay connected. What if we’re on the train? Or in a cab? I mean, we can’t just NOT send that tweet or NOT check if our new Instagram picture broke the 11-like barrier right? That would be  . As the citizens flailed about in a chaotic mess, crying out for a saviour, our local telcos came riding in on white stallions offering data plans like food to the hungry. Those who could afford it rejoiced while others griped about how expensive it was compared to our neighbouring countries — some of which could be considered less developed than we are. The problem with that is when you argue “affordability” based purely on how much a plan costs, you’re leaving other crucial factors like income, development, penetration and even freedom of Internet, out of the equation. That’s like arguing who’s the best badminton player based purely on how fast their smashes are. It seems that the folks over at Tech In Asia have had enough of this nonsense and thanks to them, we now have a better understanding (hopefully) of what affordability really means. That said, this chart doesn’t appear to differentiate between connection speeds (4G LTE, 3G, 2G, etc) so that could be another factor affecting cost.  could also be another reason for the difference in cost. We’d much rather pay a little more for a wider and more stable data connection. What do you think of this infographic? Should carriers focus more on reducing cost or improving coverage and stability? Let us know in the comments below. Thanks to   for the tip!"

It offers a decent 4.7″ HD 720p screen, dual-SIM slots and 4G LTE for under RM400.

Following the release of its metal-clad  , Xiaomi appears to be taking the same premium route for its upcoming budget device. The phone you’re seeing here has just appeared on China’s TENNA certification and it is believed to be the new Redmi 3. It gets an all metal back like its larger Redmi Note 3 but without a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. Being a unibody design, the back cover doesn’t seem to be removable, which means you can’t replace the battery on your own. According to its purported spec-sheet, there will be a microSD expansion, which is likely to be housed on the SIM tray slot.  The Redmi 3 is said to be having a slightly larger 5″ HD 720p display and it is expected to run on a higher 1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM. On-board storage is listed at 16GB and it also comes with a standard 13MP + 5MP camera combination. This is quite a huge step up, pushing the Redmi into the mid-range category, even if this was an “enhanced version”.  With better specs and premium materials, we are curious if Xiaomi could maintain its affordable 699CNY (RM463) price tag as the Redmi 2.

When 4K video recording hit the scene back in 2013, we thought capturing content at that resolution was crazy; more so, when you’re viewing it on screens that hover around 5-inches. But we’re not here to argue about whether Full HD or Quad HD screens are sufficient when it comes to actually viewing the content on them. We’re here to see how 4 smartphones perform when tasked to handle the rough and bumpy Malaysian roads that often surprise you with a new pothole or two with every passing day – obviously, OIS would be important here. The following are a breakdown of the 4 respective specs: All four devices had some form of image/video stabilisation; the Nexus 6P uses software based technology, shared also by the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual which uses its own software-based two-stage SteadyShot stabilisation. On the other hand, Apple is the only one that uses solely hardware based stabilisation. Particularly special out of the bunch, the Galaxy Note5 uses both hardware and software video stabilisation but this combination is only available when shooting up to Full HD (1080p) at 30fps."

The sad thing is that this is the same for most things, including smartphones. If you’re a smartphone buyer, odds are you have bought more than one device. The only problem is, what do you do with your old phone when your new one arrives? Do you toss it out? Give it to a niece/nephew/child (let’s be real they probably have better phones than your old   anyway)? Try to sell it to on a certain popular local forum filled with lowballers? Well,   now has a new option for you. Vmall Malaysia is currently conducting a BETA test for their “Trade-in & Go Green With Honor!” programme, in collaboration with LTG Technologies, where — yep you guessed it — you can trade in your old devices and be compensated for it. You won’t be getting money, though. Instead, you’ll be getting a Vmall code which you can then use to redeem a Vmall voucher which you can use to purchase any device on the website. To put it in simpler terms: At this moment, the number of devices per manufacturer, with the exception being   and  , is rather limited. Hopefully, they will add support for more devices further down the line. If your trade-in value is RM40 or higher, LTG will arrange for a pickup at your specified address free of charge. Once LTG receives your products, they will evaluate and see if your devices are worth the quoted amount. If they sign off on it, you will receive a Vmall voucher code of equal value to that of your devices. If they don’t, they will inform you of the new value of your device, allowing you to decide whether or not you want to take the offer. If you don’t respond within 3 days, they will automatically assume you accept the revised offer. The best thing about this programme is that you can register any amount of smartphones, from old and functioning to broken phones (yes they accept broken phones if it is within their criteria). However, remember to register all your devices at one go so that you receive a single code for a single voucher. Not only will this help you hit that RM40 free delivery sweet spot, it will also help when you make purchases on Vmall, because you can only use one voucher per purchase. Keep in mind that this programme is only in BETA but it is expected to go live sometime early next year. If you’ve had your eye on an honor or Huawei device, this seems like a pretty decent incentive to go and get one."

Can you confidently tell how far apart one building is from the next and navigate it without a proper scale? What about those little parts that are obscured by a building or a shadow? Can you tell what’s hidden there? Now imagine all of that detail compressed into the body of a baby girl and you’ve only begun to scrape the surface of how difficult surgeon Dr Redmond Burke’s operation was. Teegan Lexcen, a 4-month-old baby was admitted into the Niklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami, Florida because she was born with a misplaced heart. Without surgery, she would be dead by Christmas. The worst part? Doctors couldn’t see a way in to operate. I don’t think I need to tell you how delicate heart surgery is, or how difficult it can be. It becomes nigh impossible when you don’t have all the information you need. Burke says that surgeons need to be able to visualise the entire procedure before they step into the operating room, which is why many surgical teams passed on Teegan’s operation because they kept running into walls during this process: It seemed inoperable. Burke had the same problem as he had no way of knowing if a standard incision over the sternum would be enough, but “inoperable” was not a word he enjoyed using. Exhausting medical solutions, the team began looking for creative solutions and one particularly enterprising member uploaded the scans of Teegan’s chest to  , converting them into 3D stereoscopic imagines, which allowed them to view it in VR. Virtual Reality. That was the answer. Burke said that with   and a smartphone he was able to see the patient’s entire heart by simply tilting his head. He could turn it and manipulate it as if he was already in the operating room. From there, Burke could see Teegan’s heart as well as her chest wall and with that information, he knew that a standard incision would indeed be fine. According to Burke, this solution came just in the nick of time; any longer and her kidneys may have suffered too much from her being put under. She would be alive, but on dialysis for the rest of her days. We’re floored that a little bit of cardboard and a smartphone actually saved someone’s life. That and good old fashioned human ingenuity of course. Burke views every operation as possible and it was down to whether the doctor had the confidence to perform it or not. With VR he could visualise the steps in his head and help him come up with a plan of operation for his team which allowed him to save his patient. Seven hours later, little Teegan was all patched up and ready for Christmas and ho, ho, ho-pefully for many more Christmases to come."

Perhaps Microsoft simply doesn’t know how to make good flagship mobile devices, but that’s a tough claim to make considering not many are having a go at it. Until now. Early this month, a fancy new Windows Phone dubbed the   Falcon was  . What caught everyone’s eye was the dragon it had beating at the heart of the device; a   to be specific. It was the first Windows Phone device to have been spotted with  ‘s latest baby in the driver’s seat. What’s more, the GFXBench entry also indicated that the device would feature a large 5.8″ 2560×1440 pixel panel with a 20-megapixel primary camera and a 12MP front-facing selfie camera. Mmm, yummy specs. There were some oddities, however, as memory was only listed at 1GB of RAM with a peculiar 43GB of internal storage. Then again, it isn’t uncommon for manufacturers to configure the device differently when running benchmarks. In any case, it looks like there could be a monstrous Windows Phone (likely running Windows 10 Mobile) set to be released sometime next year. In fact, a new report out of   claims that the device could see an official unveiling at the upcoming   (MWC) 2016 in Barcelona next February. However, the report also notes that HP has yet to give the project the final go-ahead. With specs that exceed even Microsoft’s own Windows flagship devices (plus it could be cheaper), could this be the Windows Phone messiah fans have been waiting for? We doubt it. Especially if Windows 10 Mobile doesn’t receive the updates it needs in time. Though we haven’t spent time with the Lumia flagships, reports and reviews point to a worrying trend of incomplete (plus buggy) software, similar to that on the Surface line of 2-in-1 devices. Reviewers have noted some minor problems such as 4K video recording not working properly to big problems like the home screen disappearing entirely after an app crashes — something that happens quite often apparently — which shouldn’t happen in a completed product. If these problems lie with Windows 10 Mobile, then all the hardware in the world won’t be able to save the experience. It is admirable that it seems like HP wants to show Microsoft how to really build a Windows 10 Mobile flagship, but unless Redmond steps up its own game, the new device will likely not amount to anything. What a shame that would be."

Using a mobile app, Uber lets you request for a clean and reliable ride, which is like a breath of fresh air in cities with failed taxi services.  The one billionth trip was taken in London on a Honda Insight Hybrid. To celebrate the occasion, the lucky rider is receiving a year’s worth of Uber rides, while the driver will be getting a well deserved holiday at a Uber city of his choice. Not bad for a short trip that only costs £5 (about RM32). To top it off, Uber is also making a charitable donation to an organisation at the neighbourhood where ride had started.  Despite its political and regulatory hurdles, Uber has been growing quite rapidly covering hundreds of cities in 68 countries worldwide. It is said that they are currently doing 3 million trips a day which is substantially more than its competitor, Lyft. While they are doing well in most markets, Uber is also facing bans and suspension by some local authority such as Spain and Germany.

OK, it’s quite useless actually since you can do practically everything on your Android smartphone anyway. So maybe  , despite how incomplete and frustrating it is, is the way to go.   certainly thinks so since what looks like their latest 12-inch Windows 10 tablet was just certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG. Rumours that Samsung were working on a 12″ Windows 10 tablet have been floating around for quite some time now but this is the first piece of solid confirmation that this device is indeed in the pipeline. According to SamMobile Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG certifications are usually a good indicator that the device is on the way to the shelves soon. The 12-inch unit bearing the model number SM-W700 is said to feature a screen resolution of either 2560×1600 or 3840×2400. On the inside, the device will allegedly be powered by a 13nm Intel Core M processor paired with 4GB of RAM. Some have said that the tablet may also come with an S Pen which, coupled with the full Windows 10 experience, could certainly improve productivity. If Samsung adds a keyboard accessory then we may have another Surface/iPad Pro challenger on our hands. As Android phones continue to get bigger, the equivalent OS tablet is becoming less and less relevant because people can already do so much on their phone. Front facing speakers plus a 5.7″ Smartphone can provide just as much immersion (if not more) as a side/rear speakered 7.9-inch tablet. It’s just not worth carrying an extra device just so you have a slightly bigger screen. Keep in mind bigger, in this sense, doesn’t always mean better as in general smartphones have a better pixel density than tablets and a better pixel density usually equals a better viewing experience. Let me put it this way, spreading a single cup of waffle batter over a baking tray the size of your palm would get you a thicker, fluffier, and more satisfying waffle versus spreading the same amount over a tray the size of a dining table. The same concept applies to screens. If you spread 1080p over a 5.7″ display, you’re bound to get a better screen than if it was spread over 12-inches of real estate. So if media consumption is not the best, productivity has to be the tablet’s redeeming factor, and in that Windows 10 beats Android hands down. Considering how wonky Windows 10 is, that’s saying quite a lot about how unoptimised Android is for the big screen. The Korean electronics giant isn’t the only one launching a Windows 10 tablet though as Xiaomi has just   in both Android and Windows 10. It has been a while since Samsung has launched a Windows-powered tablet but it seems that they’ve recognised that if you want a tablet, Android is no bueno. [ ]"

Fortunately, the government will be offering GST rebates as announced during  . To address concerns, MCMC has published the full details ahead of its implementation on new year’s day  Beginning 1st January, a RM10 prepaid reload will be sold at RM10, while a RM30 prepaid reload is sold at RM30 just like the old days.

This will be running from 1st January until 31st December 2016 and there’s no mention if it will be extended to the following year.  The good news, of course, there’s a full GST rebate on prepaid usage. This will be applicable only to Malaysian citizens based on the NRIC or police/army identification number during registration. According to MCMC, the 6% GST will be refunded within 24 hours. So if you’ve topped up RM10, you should be getting the earlier deducted RM0.57 back to your prepaid account. In a nutshell, Malaysians should be able to enjoy the full reload amount but provided that you’re registered. You are advised to check with your telco provider to ensure they have your correct details.  The GST rebate is only for prepaid users, so Malaysian postpaid users will still continue to incur the 6% charge in their monthly bills.

Rory Lee,What if your car could see?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/23/what-if-your-car-could-see/,"autonomous cars,SegNet,self-driving cars",Cool stuff,2015-12-23,"Autonomous cars are the next big thing. Well, it’s actually the current-to-next big thing, but we digress. The point is that people are apparently bored of driving cars and want systems and programs to drive them around everywhere so that they can sit in the back seat and pretend to be Donald Trump. The only problem with self-driving cars is that they aren’t able to function properly in the real world as you simply can’t replace human instinct and reaction when things on the road get challenging. Why? Because cars can’t see in real time the way we do, so it makes it very difficult to make split second decisions when that double parked car pulls out suddenly. Apparently, now they can. 
 Thanks to SegNet, a new system created by the University of Cambridge, your dreams of being driven around by software might just come into fruition. SegNet can “read” the road in front if it, allowing it to differentiate various elements like the sky, other cars, road markings and even people. SegNet “sees” the road in an RGB image and then classifies different layers and objects using a   of the scene. According to the release, the system can “take an image of a street scene it hasn’t seen before and classify it, sorting objects into 12 different categories in real time”. It can also apparently deal with light, shadow and night environments and currently labels more than 90% of pixels correctly. Unlike laser/radar-guided systems that require expensive base sensors which cost more than the car itself, SegNet has been “trained” by a group of Cambridge undergraduates who manually labelled every pixel in over 5,000 images. Once that was complete, the researchers proceeded to train the system for over 2 days, after which one of the students notes that it is surprisingly good at recognising things in an image. From our testing, we tend to agree. It does a remarkable job at differentiating between the 12 elements though there is quite a lot of polishing to do, especially at night. As this system is “trained” though, it can only get better over time as it sees more images and learns to recognise more elements. One of the biggest problems about driving around in Malaysia is that the lines are never where they should be. Add that to the fact that people double park like there is no tomorrow and that the roads have potholes the size of Canada, even human beings would have trouble navigating our treacherous streets, what more a software? With this though, there is the potential to train the system to recognise these little nuances that make up our little snowflake of a country. Given the right circumstances, the possibilities are quite endless. Although the researchers say that this is still far from being able to be implemented into autonomous cars, we could possibly see this in a domestic robot – like a robot vacuum cleaner – in the short term. From where we stand, trust in an autonomous car seems to be the biggest hurdle for people to overcome. Would you relinquish control of your car in a highway to a computer program developed by some bloke in a laboratory?

Competition outside of Apple has everyone trying to “emulate” the Surface(s) and what they can do.

And we mean big feature. As our demands for smartphone performance and portability grows, manufacturers have often skimmed on battery life to ensure that their device stays as lean and mean as possible. But that means they hardly ever last a day, much less two days. Carrying a power bank or a charger has become a norm in our society. Acer has good news for those who want raw, unadulterated battery power, because their   smartphone comes with an enormous 4,000 mAh replaceable battery. With a battery this size it becomes very unlikely that you will need to carry a powerbank around, much less another battery. In fact, that massive battery supports USB OTG (on-the-go) charging so you can even help a friend out by giving them a quick top-up if their device is running low on battery. Mighty handy in a pinch and for RM659, this is one of the most affordable and good valued devices with a 4,000 mAh battery that supports OTG charging in Malaysia. This is because the device itself does boast pretty decent specs, with a quad-core MediaTek processor clocked at 1.3GHz paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. This should ensure that everyday tasks and light to moderate application multitasking will go on without a hitch. It also has a 5.5-inch HD IPS panel and an 8-megapixel front and rear camera combo. 8-megapixels is quite a lot for a front facing camera, especially in this device’s price bracket. Even some flagship devices only rock a 5MP sensor. More megapixels mean that your selfies will be much more detailed and less pixelated. If you don’t fancy such a big device, or you simply feel that you don’t need all that battery power, Acer does offer a smaller device with a 5” HD IPS display, the Acer  . The name suggests that this smartphone would be a downgrade from the the Liquid Z630, but it also shares its bigger brother’s internal hardware as well as camera optics. That’s a pretty good deal for RM559. Acer also has an entry level device in the Liquid Z line, the Liquid  , priced at RM439. It comes bundled with a 1.1GHz Snapdragon 210 quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM running underneath its 4.5” screen. That should be more than enough for you to get a feel of what the Android experience is all about, making this device the perfect starter smartphone for anyone. All three devices will have blazingly fast dual-SIM 4G LTE connectivity and will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Acer’s Liquid UI running over it. Additionally, these devices will have the Acer Float Apps which essentially allows users to open more than one application and multitask at the same time. Acer also bundles a Float Caller which appears as a mini popup when a call comes in, letting the user decide how to respond without interrupting what they’re doing. Every one of the trio will also have what Acer calls the Quick Mode. The Quick Mode functions to allow users to pick between three customised layout options: Standard Mode (for those familiar with smartphones), Easy Mode (for those just starting out), and Basic Mode (locks down application and usage for kids). There is also a Kids Center application which grants parental control over the device for a safer browsing, viewing and playing environment for your child. These devices also come with Acer’s Bluelightshield which reduces strain on the eyes by reducing the amount of blue light emissions from the display."

That’s usually a buyer’s biggest criteria when looking for a smartphone. It’s also what people look for when determining the value-for-money aspect of a device, as consumers will try their best to squeeze every bit of horsepower for as low of a price as possible. It is these buyers that were ultimately disappointed when   launched the   because it had decidedly mediocre specs for a not-low-at-all asking price of USD400. In a world where smartphone manufacturers are churning out devices with incredible specs for an equally incredible low price, this is simply unacceptable. Thankfully, HTC’s new “hero” device seems to rectify this problem, to some extent at least. Rumours have been floating around for awhile now about HTC’s new  . Early leaks suggested that it could run the  , which reignited the fire within the hearts of many an HTC fan. However, as time progressed, the rumours changed and on paper it looked like the One X9  . Well, the device has finally come out from the shadows and at first glance, it definitely doesn’t look like the flagship device everyone was clamouring for. Then again, since this was launched this year, were we realistically expecting it to outperform the   especially since it doesn’t even bear the M badge? The One X9 sports a 5.5″ 1080p panel (though there doesn’t seem to be any information on whether it will be an AMOLED or IPS screen) which results in a pixel density of 401 ppi that HTC claims has a 170-degree viewing angle. On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 processor and 3GB of RAM with 32GB of internal storage. Thankfully, HTC has included a microSD slot that allows expansion up to 2TB. It will also feature a reasonably large 3,000 mAh battery and support for dual-SIM. Optics-wise, the device sports a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera with optical image stabilisation and 4K video recording, plus a 5MP f/2.8 front-facing shooter. It is likely that the device will come pre-loaded with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, much like the HTC One A9. Although the specs are nothing to shout about, the device does bring back HTC’s much-loved BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers, something that is missing from it’s smaller brother, the One A9. HTC also went further down “nostalgia alley”, bringing back their backlit capacitive keys, which is placed where the HTC logo usually goes. One aspect that will be missed is the absence of a fingerprint sensor, something that is available on the HTC One A9. Another serving of good news is that the metallic smartphone looks to retail at a lower price than the One A9, coming in at 2,399 Yuan, which translates to around RM1,598. Yes, if you did pick up on it, the retail price is in CNY which means that this device — as of now — has only been launched in China with no information about availability elsewhere. This device, it seems, represents HTC’s stab at trying to get a bigger cut of the affordable premium smartphone market by competing with other Chinese manufacturers on their home soil. If you think horsepower is the be all and end all of smartphones, then this HTC One X9 will look like another disappointing HTC “hero” device that could have been so much more. It isn’t the best value-for-money device out there, but is a device’s worth measured only by how well it does on benchmarks? Sure, 4GB of RAM looks good on paper, but can you realistically feel the difference between 4GB and 3GB of RAM? Fit and finish has always been one of HTC’s strongest selling points. That and their front-facing speakers, both of which can be found on One X9. It honestly doesn’t look too bad either — except for that slightly sketchy camera visor — and based on the company’s track record, they certainly know how to do metal unibodies. The device’s closest competitor would probably be the Sony Xperia M5 Dual, and based on build alone, we definitely prefer a metal finish to the Xperia M5 Dual’s fingerprint-magnet glass-plastic construction. With proper optimisation, these specs should get you through day-to-day usage without a hitch and for a frankly reasonable price tag, this doesn’t seem like that bad a deal for HTC fans. Yeah, sure, you won’t be able to brag about it to your friends but then again, there aren’t that many brag-worthy HTC devices to begin with. With HTC’s flagships only managing to stay afloat as well as the Titanic could, perhaps the midrange premium market is where they can reclaim some of their former glory."

Customers have a choice of two Celcom  : the   and  , both of which are designed to give you more data when you need it most. As you can tell by the colour, both data plans are designed for different users. For the more casual user, the Celcom FIRST Blue offers a monthly quota of 6GB of internet for only RM45 a month. The quota is split between three categories, where users get to have 2GB of monthly Internet, 2GB of free Internet on weekends (500MB every weekend), as well as 2GB of complimentary Celcom WiFi. The Celcom FIRST Blue plan also gives its users a cool 50 minutes of talktime and 50 free SMSs to all networks. Meanwhile, designed with the heavy user in mind, the Celcom FIRST Gold plan takes it up a notch, offering an accumulative Internet quota of 12GB each month. The quota, much like the FIRST Blue, will be split three ways which amounts to 4GB of monthly Internet, 4GB of free Internet on the weekends (1GB free every weekend) and 4GB of complimentary Celcom WiFi. Celcom FIRST Gold adopters will also receive double the talktime and free SMSs, at 100 minutes of talktime and 100 free text messages, to all networks. This means that if you sign up for any of Celcom’s FIRST plans, you can record a video of that beautiful sunrise from the top of Broga Hill and upload it to YouTube without worrying about it affecting your daily quota. It truly brings a great new meaning to separating business from pleasure. So go ahead and enjoy Celcom’s amazing 4G LTE speeds that will let you surf up to 10 times what you would normally get from a regular network connection. The good news doesn’t end there as Celcom FIRST subscribers will be entitled to free unlimited music streaming on Yonder Music. That means more awesome tunes streaming right to your phone so you get all the enjoyment without the headache of having to use up your precious smartphone storage. Better yet, if you have had a particularly economical month in terms of quota, Celcom FIRST rewards you by letting you carry over your unutilised monthly Internet to the next month. That means no more rushing to eek out every little bit of that quota near the end of the month! While most of you must be wondering if there is a catch, or perhaps even a contract to this plan, rest assured as Celcom doesn’t believe in tying you down with contracts for their FIRST data plans. As a testament to how committed Celcom is to providing its customers with a good deal, you can enjoy all of the fantastic privileges that come with the FIRST plan without the fear of being unable to terminate your plan due to a contract. Additionally, Celcom offers an extended credit limit of up to 5 times the extra credit limit of your monthly commitment value. With Auto Debit payments, you can also enjoy 5% savings over your monthly bill. Everything cool needs a club and Celcom’s FIRST plans are no exception. Subscribers will get to be part of the FIRST club which offers exclusive rewards and privileges designed only for club members, that range from additional free Internet calls, SMS and many more. What’s more, Celcom is having millions of movie ticket giveaways worth millions every month, letting you catch that epic year-end blockbuster movie without worrying about buying a ticket! There are three different ways you can participate and grab a gift code for the movie tickets: 
1. For new customers, simply sign up for a new Celcom FIRST plan (either Blue or Gold) 
2. For existing customers, purchase a Max Up at only RM20 a month for 1GB of data and free unlimited streaming on Yonder Music 
3. Alternatively, you can also purchase either a Samsung Galaxy Note5, Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ or a Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 with Celcom FIRST.

Of course, there are others that will consider pre-installed software as unnecessary bloatware, and proclaim plain vanilla is the way to go. Whichever side you pick, let’s take a look at the Chinese manufacturers.  With Apple seen as a status symbol, most of these Chinese smartphone UI lacks an App Drawer. Yes, it can be simple for first timers but power users might find it cluttered or annoying when it comes to organising their home screens. Of course, another popularity with Chinese Android UI is the wide availability of themes that you can customise to your preference. So Xiaomi has their MIUI, while Huawei has their very own EMUI. On the current version, EMUI looks awfully similar to Xiaomi’s own interface from the flat icon design, to the minimalistic approach for its built-in apps such as phone dialer, alarm clock, stopwatch, toggle switches and even the menu page. Even the shutdown menu interface that’s displayed after long pressing the power button looks the same as well.

So far there’s no word of its release but it is likely to be running out of the box with their upcoming 2016 models. Disappointingly, it still runs on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop instead of the very latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow. At the rate these Chinese companies are going, they all might end up looking the same and the only difference is the exterior and the logo plastered at the back. What do you guys think? Do you fancy these app-drawerless interfaces or the mainstream offering from Samsung, HTC, ASUS and Sony?"

User AFChimpanse took to the   forums yesterday and shared a story about how his/her brand new Nexus 5X had a meltdown, literally. According to the OP (original poster), the device was sitting in his/her pocket when suddenly it started heating up. When the OP took it out, it continued to heat up and started producing a “low frizzling sound” releasing an “extremely toxic smell”. The smartphone eventually got too hot to hold in the hand and the OP had to put it down. When (we’re assuming the frizzling had died down) the device was picked up again, the user noticed that a portion of the back cover to the right of the LG logo had melted inwards. User DarcyFitz and GlassHalfFull pointed out that it should be a battery issue judging from the location of the melted bit relative to the device’s internals identified by iFixit’s teardown photo: According to AFChimpanse, the device was only 11 days old and had never been plugged into a third-party charger before.

What most people do not realise is that there are users (in fact a considerable majority) who use their devices in the configuration it came out of the box, fearing to dig deeper into their device’s settings in the event something disastrous happens.

Before you get too excited, mind you that the actual mobile data is only 6GB and it gets an extra 4GB for weekend use (1GB per weekend).  The balance 30GB?

Many, ourselves included, felt that Microsoft shipped an unfinished product. From what we gathered, it isn’t the hardware that the Surface users are unhappy about, rather it was the software implementation that let the devices down. What’s worse, Microsoft’s “solution” to the problem was an apology on their forums which only served to irk more users. Now though, they seem to have actually come up with a solution to at least one of their problems. Besides the issues with the device’s power drainage during sleep and random reboots, one other nagging issue was the Surface device’s keyboard and touchpad. The much improved Surface Pro 4 Type Cover keyboard was so advanced, it seemed, that it didn’t deem the Surface Pro 4 a worthy device and thus refused to pair with it properly. The Surface Pro 4 had issues connecting with its keyboard, especially when removing the Type Cover and reattaching it, bugging out the mouse cursors and other modes for Continuum. For us, the problems were more rudimentary when it came to the Surface Pro 4. We found out that if the keyboard was attached when the device was off, it wouldn’t detect the keyboard when we switched it on, forcing us to disengage and reattach the keyboard to the device. This update also affects Surface Book users, where apparently the device had problems with its touchpad and keyboard as well. Here are the  changelogs: If you were anywhere near as excited as us for the launch of the Surface Pro 4, and dropped a considerable chunk of your savings to get one with the Type Cover keyboard, I’m sure you were equally crestfallen when you discovered that Microsoft already knew the device had issues yet still decided to put it in the market. While doing something like this is, frankly, unforgivable, you’d think that a company as big as Microsoft would have some kind of fix ready almost immediately after it put an unfinished product on sale. Instead, they said that major fixes would  . In any case, these problems seem to be software based, and fixable via updates so if you’ve bought a Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book device, our advice is to hunker down and weather this initial storm in the hopes that your device will eventually live up to its full potential. If you’re still on the fence about purchasing one, stay tuned to our upcoming review of the Surface Pro 4 where we will be taking a close look at the device, all of its problems, fixes and more."

Being relatively candid on the subject, Pichai jests that he’ll take his mum’s considerations when the time comes to name Android N, though it won’t only be her he’ll be looking to; supposedly, Google will also run an online poll to help decide if the N stands for Nougat, Nutella or something entirely different. Speaking mainly to an Indian crowd, one of the attendees asked about why there has never been an Android version named after sweets and desserts from India, Google’s CEO replied “When I meet my mom, I’ll ask her for suggestions” He added the following regarding the next nickname: “Maybe what I’ll do next time, is when we’re working on the next release of Android, Android N, maybe we’ll do an online poll on what the name should be. And if all Indians vote…. I think we can make it happen!” From the super sweet list below, it’ll be tough to see anything other than something sweet make the list: Android is widely adopted across the globe and while most of these nicknames have their namesake desserts/sweets originating from western countries, maybe Google will let globalisation do its own thing, allowing international sweets to be a part of the fun.

Though you’d think that a frequently visited site used for work would deserve a bookmark or at least remembrance of the URL. Moving on, there were searches regarding BR1M 2015, the annual subsistence handout by our government; How-Old.net, an application that tells you how old it thinks you are (duh); and some local shows/movies. No surprise as the “USD to MYR” was searched highly too, followed by “GST” and the “Bersih 4.0″ rally. For the top 10 most searched individuals list, it seemed that Malaysians looked for information regarding notable people who passed away during the year. That includes, the late: Lee Kuan Yew, Former Prime Minister of Singapore; Paul Walker, the famous actor that passed away during a car crash; and Kevin Morais, the murdered deputy prosecutor. Our current Prime Minister was also on the list, while athlete Farah Ann Abdul Hadi made her way on it as well (for obvious, gymnastic attire reasons). People also kept up with international news, as searches for the missing QZ8501 airplane, the Paris Attacks and ISIS, topped the list for trending news searches. The list of searches really show what we’re looking for, be it happenings of the world or an important individual. Given the growth of the Internet and Google being one of the go-to search engines (seriously, who still uses Yahoo or Bing?), we’ll continue to see what sort of information our country is keen to look for, hopefully John Cena won’t make the list again next year."

Ahead of the official Malaysian premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Google has thrown together an interesting new Chrome web browser experience that lets you wield a lightsaber to fend off First Order Stormtroopers. The Lightsaber Escape game uses a simple mechanism that lets you wield your phone as if it was a lightsaber and slay Stormtroopers on either your laptop or computer in an attempt to escape a space station. Here’s how you play: Simply log on to the Lightsaber Escape   with your laptop or computer, then enter the URL displayed on the resulting web page into your phone. Once there, your phone should begin calibrating its accelerometer and upon completion, turn into the lightsaber it was always meant to be. You can then either play it on your computer’s monitor or cast/hook it up to a projector and have some theater level fun like we did. When you’re calibrated and past the tutorial mission, that’s when the real fun begins. The game takes you on an on-rail action adventure through a space station filled with Stormtroopers who happen to be surprisingly accurate. With your trusty lightsaber equipped, you will engage in ranged combat, where you deflect blaster fire back at your attackers,  as well as melee combat. We haven’t made it far enough into the game where we’ve encountered a Sith yet, so do let us know in the comments below if you have. It is a fantastic experience we highly recommend to anyone, Star Wars fan or otherwise especially since it works on both iOS and Android. We did encounter some input lag in our adventures through the game as well as some drops in framerate but that is kind of expected when playing a browser game. The experience in itself more than makes up for it though, so all is forgiven. Maybe by the next installment of the Star Wars franchise we will be able to play this (or something like this) in virtual reality."

Now though, that visor has become a signature of the latest Nexus device and at a glance, people can easily differentiate it from its less powerful brother the Nexus 5X. The thing is, while Huawei decided to set that visor apart, letting it dominate in its blackness across the top of the phone, HTC seems to have tried to “hide” their “visor” by painting it the same colour as the rest of the device. Again, apprehensive is the word we could best use to describe those looks. That said, taste varies between the individual so there obviously will be people who completely dig that look. Around the front of the device, HTC seems to have gone “retro” with the inclusion of capacitive buttons along the bottom of the device (where their logo usually is) while the HTC logo has moved to the device’s forehead. There also seems to be, what looks like, a pair of front facing speakers (which we hope are BoomSound speakers) as well as a front facing camera. The HTC One X9 recently  . revealing what looks to be some frankly disappointing specifications. It looks like the device will be running an octa-core 2.2GHz processor (which rules out the Snapdragon 820 and Helios X20 rumoured earlier) mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable via microSD up to 1TB. The smartphone also looks to sport a 5.5″ full HD IPS display (1920×1080 pixels). In terms of optics, the device will get a 13MP primary camera with an LED flash and a 5-megapixel selfie shooter on the front. It is also rumoured to run Android 5.0.1 Lollipop (likely with HTC’s Sense UI on top) out of the box. To be fair, we couldn’t really expect this to be a full-fledged flagship device, especially since it doesn’t bear the M badge. One could hope, right?"

And those who got picked to go on the trip certainly got a huge morale boost. I like companies that do crazy things like this and I guess Morten subscribes to the belief that if you take care of your employees, your employees will take care of your customers. And if your customers are happy, your company should be doing ok. Some may disagree but I think Maxis is one of the better mobile operators in Malaysia. They are not perfect but they’re doing the right things. I hope the positive vibe that Morten is spreading to his employees carries through to the customer experience.

The details on this XOX affiliate programme are still in the wind, with the website only stating that it “helps you grow your income without having to do very much at all. Or at least helping you in cutting your monthly phone bills in the simplest way!” You’ll find details of their postpaid plan below: When we called to find out how this system works, we were told to attend a “dealer orientation” – sketchy, at best.

We’ve left out contact details and await a call from an XOX representative and we’ll be sure to let everyone know the outcome. Also to those wondering, XOX piggybacks on Celcom’s cellular network.

It has been a while since we’ve seen a flagship Lumia and the last one was the   back in early 2014. After Microsoft took the helm of the mobile business, they are mostly preoccupied with entry to mid-range devices running on Windows Phone 8.1. After almost 2 years of waiting, the   and   have officially landed in Malaysia. Not only this is the first flagship Lumia under the Microsoft banner, but most importantly they are the first Windows 10 smartphones in the market. Like most flagships today, Microsoft is going with a two size approach for its flagship. The Lumia 950 with a compact 5.2″ display is going for RM2,699 while its larger 5.7″ “phablet” model, the Lumia 950 XL is priced at RM2,999. That’s a significant price jump over its predecessors, and you can partly blame our foreign exchange rates for that. The internals has the best specs you would expect from a flagship, which includes Quad HD displays, Snapdragon 808/810 processors, 3GB of RAM and a minimum of 32GB of storage.

The question is, will it change Microsoft’s success in the local market? Let’s see if Digi enterprise/business customers take advantage of this special deal. The smaller of the two, the Lumia 950 will be absolutely free of charge though it’ll come with a hefty monthly fee of RM 238 on a 2 year (24 months) contract – working out to a huge RM 5,712 total. It isn’t just for the phone, as you’ll be getting 10GBs of mobile data, totally unlimited calls, text and instant messaging (WhatsApp and WeChat). If you’d prefer something bigger and more powerful, the Lumia 950 XL will be available too. You’ll get the same plan as talked about above, at the same monthly price, but you’ll have to fork out an additional RM 330 upfront for the smartphone itself; bringing you to an eventual RM 6,042 total cost. Given that spending RM 238 per month doesn’t sound as practical for someone who doesn’t use all that bundled data, calls/texts and instant messaging, you can bump that price down by choosing other Digi plans that will be announced on the 18th of December; mind you, the two smartphones’ will cost more, but you’ll be paying less monthly.

They flooded the online stores on   and   which resulted in an impressive   itself. However, purchasing anything online can be rather risky because sometimes, mix ups can happen. Local Ian Oz found this out the hard way. He, like many other Nexus 6P fans, ordered the device off Lazada’s website, however, when the package arrived, instead of unwrapping a brand spanking new smartphone, Ian unwrapped a pair of…earrings? Oh dear. 
 It turns out Lazada had somehow screwed up the order and sent Ian six pairs of earrings (worth RM58), which were initially meant for someone named Irene Yeow. The worst part was that based on the receipt, Irene’s earrings were meant to go Johor, which in case you didn’t know, is in another state. As it looks like Lazada had mistakenly stuffed the earrings into the Nexus 6P package, it seems likely that Ian’s smartphone was stuffed into the earrings package. The good news is that there is a contact number included in the shipping invoice. Ian, obviously outraged, took his irritation onto the social media, posting a picture of his receipt on Huawei’s Facebook page. Luckily, Huawei responded fairly quickly and ensured Ian that they had escalated the problem to their core fulfillment team and Lazada. What we don’t understand is how a mistake like this could be made in the first place. On the Pos Laju statement, it clearly states that the package should weigh 0.2kg (Nexus 6P weighs around 178g) which reflects the device’s weight, but it seems unlikely that six pairs of earrings would weigh the same as Google’s latest device. Nevertheless, paying RM58 for a brand new Nexus 6P seems like a phenomenal deal. Where can we sign up for it? In all seriousness though, we wish Ian luck in the retrieval of his device because we know how terrible it must feel to pay over two and a half thousand ringgit only for your shipment to be messed up.

Just when you thought nobody will pull the same trick here in Malaysia, think again. A local paper had reported several customers being held against their will until they pay up more than what was agreed upon.  A 28-year-old victim was reported to be buying 4 phones at RM200 each at Kota Raya Shopping Complex. However after making the payment of RM800, he was told to enter a secluded room where he was locked up for hours. He was then told to pay an exorbitant RM10,000 fee for his release. Eventually, the victim was set free, but not after he withdrawn RM5,000 from an ATM. To rub salt to the wound, the 4 phones which he got was different from what was shown earlier.  Obviously, the next thing to do was to report to the relevant authorities. He was said to have complained to several agencies including the Ministry of trade and Consumer Affairs, but no action has been taken. As a last resort, he seeks help from PPIM (Persatuan Pengguna Islam Malaysia) which proceeded to raid the shop.  From the operation, it was found that there are a number of phone shops at Kota Raya that are selling counterfeit products at skyrocketed prices. In total, they had managed to cover as much as RM11,900 on behalf of 7 victims. Apart from locals, these shops tend to target foreigners especially women that would often fall prey to such tactics. As always, it is advisable to shop at reputable retailers and beware of dodgy dealers that offer unbelievable deals. If the deal is too good to be true, then it probably is. This isn’t just limited to expensive phone models as we’ve seen   in the market as well.

Hold on a minute, the latest Android hasn’t even gone mainstream but they want to talk about the future? Representing Google during an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session, the 6-man team chipped in on a slew of topics, including: the direction of Pixel C and the future of Android. If you’re asking why there’s such a bridging of the two; it’s mainly due to a merger that’s reported to take place come 2017. The report suggests that heads at Google think combining the two makes the most sense, since Android has had an early start as an operating system for quite some time. And we’re already starting to see small changes that point towards a unification in latest Pixel product. Google’s Pixel branding has been have over the place, of late; partly due to the Pixel C choosing Android over Chrome OS. This further points to a crossover of operating systems and that might mean more “desktop”-like capabilities to ease productivity in the following phase of Android. So while mediating all these unanswered questions regarding the switch, the software team thought it would be a great idea to hold an AMA session. Allowing users to ask whatever they needed to. But it was surprising that the developers choose to share two facts about Android N, given that non-Nexus devices have yet to receive Marshmallow. The first of the two is a proper split-screen/multi-window function that we’ve already seen on iOS (iPad Pro only) and some Android OEM skins as well. This pretty much only applies to tablets since it’ll be a tiresome experience navigating multiple windows on your smartphone screen. Another feature that came about was DisplayPort via USB Type-C connector, that a competitor has put to good use – yes, we’re looking at Windows with their Continuum support. A trend that you could see a mile away, with more people dropping PCs for day to day task and opting convertibles that are slowly catching up in the processor department. These replies below were from the team themselves: Faster processors in smaller packages are already here and they’ll only continue to get better. And you can expect us to start using smaller devices on bigger screens real soon. Oh and maybe a Pixel smartphone?

Almost 2 years ago, YTL was   to be testing   on 2.3GHz, which supposedly is more efficient in bandwidth and cost. Utilising Time Division instead of Frequency Division, TD-LTE requires just one channel for download/upload as opposed to having a pair of frequencies for the same purpose.  In Malaysia, our existing telcos are running on FDD-LTE, while TD-LTE is commonly used in China and India. Whether   boils down to the telco itself. It is not what you have, but how you manage your network and your customer experience.  Seamless transition from WiMAX, is also a factor why YTL favours TD-LTE.

Powering the device is Intel’s Atom x7-Z8700 2.4GHz Quad-Core processor that’s mated to 2GB of RAM. Onboard, it gets 32GB of storage which you can expand via a microSD up to 128GB. The Predator 8’s IPS display claims to have 100% NTSC colour gamut that provides a vibrant and accurate colour reproduction. The included MediaMaster settings let you optimise the display and audio for gaming, movie, photo viewing and standard modes.  The main highlight, of course, would be its Predator Quadio (Quad Audio) setup that offers a virtual surround sound. Whether you’re holding it in landscape or portrait mode, it is smart enough to switch orientation automatically.  Despite its chunky utilitarian appearance, it is 8.7mm thin and weighs 350 grams including its 4,420mAh battery. It does feel solid in the hands while the red coloured speaker grills protrude out from each corner to remind you that this is no ordinary tablet. There’s no 3G/4G mobile connectivity, but it has your usual Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and 802.11n WiFi with 2×2 MIMO support.  Should you need to take pictures, it gets a 2MP shooter at the front while the rear gets a 5MP camera. At time of writing, it runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop. The Acer Predator 8 will go on sale in Malaysia starting next week with the retail price tag of RM1,499. To get your game on, they have also pre-installed Asphalt 8 with 320,000 credits worth US$50."

Well, we actually don’t know if this is good news or just slightly sad news because apparently Apple is already preparing a March 2016 event to unveil the second generation Apple Watch alongside what could be the 4-inch “iPhone 6c”. 9to5Mac reports that the second-generation wearable could possibly start shipping in April, a full year after the first device was launched.

A term, to the layman, that is commonly associated with a certain ugly vehicular abomination that claims to be green and is well loved by Hollywood actors who want to appear environmentally conscious.

The tablet attaches to its keyboard via magnets, but the thing that we found great was the fact that the keyboard has a solid base which means you can use it on your lap. For more information on the tablet and its keyboard, head on over  . Marketing it as a tablet with a keyboard means that the Pixel C was not exactly designed to be a hybrid laptop or tablet.

Sony has done it with the Xperia Z4 Tablet, Samsung has Galaxy Tab S, ASUS has the Transformer, and even Google themselves have the Nexus 9 with a keyboard. The Pixel C is currently available in the Google Store with prices starting at USD499 (around RM2,130). The magnetic keyboard is a USD149 (around RM635) optional extra, but it does also come with a folio keyboard, similar to the Nexus 9’s and will also be priced at USD149. Based on these figures, the Pixel C looks like its a pretty good bargain, especially if you compare it with the Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet which will set you back RM2,699 for the device and another RM799 for the accompanying keyboard. Unfortunately, the Pixel C isn’t available in Malaysia. As of this moment there doesn’t seem to be any information on availability in our market but we do hope they will bring it over soon so that we can see first hand what Google thinks is the proper way to build a tablet."

These are synonymous with Apple. People may disagree with a lot of things but many will agree that when it comes to making something as ubiquitous as a smartphone look like a work of art, Apple does it best. But sometimes, even the best get it wrong. This is the Apple Smart Battery Case. It’s the company’s first ever battery pack and it’s decidedly un-Apple. More on that later but first, let’s go into the specs. The Smart Battery Case is a battery pack that fits the   and  . It packs a 1,877mAh battery and Apple says it’s good for 18 hours of internet browsing time on LTE or 20 hours of video playback time. The battery case has a soft touch silicone exterior with a microfibre inner lining to protect your iPhone. There are two colours to choose from (white and charcoal gray) currently and it’s the only battery case that comes with a lighting connector. So why is the Smart Battery Case un-Apple? It’s the design. Next to the slim, sleek and slender iPhone 6, the Smart Battery Case, with its unsightly bulge, looks like an afterthought, like the designers at Apple didn’t even bother to make this thing look good. It’s not that great as a battery case either. There’s no separate switch to activate or deactivate the battery case and the lack of an external battery indicator makes it difficult to know how much power you have left without turning on your iPhone. You do however get an integrated battery status built into iOS when the battery case is plugged into your iPhone but that means you will have to turn on your phone every time you want check the power status of the battery case. And for the   asking price, you’re not getting a lot. A popular battery case alternative like the   with a 2,750mAh battery pack, a dedicated on/off switch and external LED indicators costs about the same. So if you’re an iPhone 6 or 6S user that’s constantly looking for a power point because your iPhone is out of battery, you might want to stay away from the Apple Battery Pack. It’s ugly, it’s expensive and for something that’s designed for the iPhone by the makers of the iPhone itself, it’s decidedly un-Apple. Maybe Apple took some inspiration from the device below.

Now in its 7th generation, Google has partnered with Huawei with the all new  . It isn’t just another reference device but an upmarket one that could very well compete with the current crop of flagship smartphones. After its   in late September, the Nexus 6P is finally here in Malaysia and you can place your orders beginning this Thursday, 10th December. Available in a single 64GB storage variant, the Nexus 6P is priced officially at RM2,698 inclusive of GST. For Malaysia, we are getting two colour options – Aluminium and Graphite. So far there’s no news of its other Gold and Frost White versions. In terms of size, the Nexus 6P despite its “6” moniker has a 5.7″ screen which makes it more compact than last year’s Nexus 6 by Motorola. The AMOLED screen pushes a Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440 that gives a pixel density of 518 pixels per inch. The exterior is where the Nexus 6P stands out. It gets an all-metal unibody design with a “helmet visor” bump at the back that houses its camera module. Accompanying its high-resolution screen is a pair of stereo speakers which is perfect for gaming and audio playback. For the first time on a Nexus, the Nexus 6P also gets a fingerprint scanner at the back that’s natively supported by Android Marshmallow. Like most rear-mounted fingerprint scanners, it unlocks instantly in a single touch. Powering the device is a flagship class 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor mated with 3GB of RAM, which should be more than sufficient to provide a buttery smooth experience. Like all Nexus smartphones (except for the Nexus One by HTC), there’s no expandable microSD slot and it comes with a single nano SIM slot supporting 4G LTE. In terms of cameras, the Nexus 6P focuses on larger pixels rather than the usual pixel count. Despite having a 12.3MP sensor from Sony, it boasts a larger 1.55 μm pixel size that allows in more light and this apparently is good enough to compensate for the lack of an Optical Image Stabilisation. It gets a dual-tone LED flash, Phase Detection and Laser Auto Focus so that you won’t miss a shot. Over at the front, selfies are taken care by its rather large 8MP shooter. Keeping the lights on, the Nexus 6P has a generous 3,450mAh battery and it charges up via a reversible USB Type C port. Out of the box, you get 2 sets of cables – a USB Type-C to Type-C and the standard USB Type-C to full sized USB. The power adapter pushes a higher 3Amp output through a USB Type-C port which should be faster than standard 2Amp chargers in the market. Of course the main reason why anyone would get a Nexus, is for its pure Android experience without the unnecessary fluff that’s often preinstalled by OEMs. The Nexus 6P will be available online this Thursday (10th December) through Huawei’s   and   Online store. Those who snap up units quickly, Huawei will be throwing in an introductory offer of a   (the first version) worth RM 199, totally free of charge to the first 600. The Nexus 6P also comes with a 1 year one-to-one swap program through Huawei Service Centres."

With the current generation of smartphone cameras breaking barriers and capable of some amazing photographs, given the right conditions; what does the flagship Nexus have to offer? Utilising Sony’s lens on the rear and front, the device in question doesn’t boast an amazing pixel count, only at 12.3-megapixel. It also doesn’t have optical image stabilisation, which by today’s standards could be a big no-no Google does however bet on the sensors large pixel size, listed at 1.55 µm to compensate the fact that the lens has no Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS). A combination of an aperture of f/2.0 and the larger micrometre would mean that it’ll absorb a lot more light, at least on paper; making shots in low light scenes easier to manage. Also, PDAF and laser autofocus makes a formidable duo, mediating those poorly dialed in images."

The PRIV does have a trick up its sleeve though as it features a physical QWERTY keyboard that slides out from under its display. This slide out keyboard also functions as a touchpad for scrolling that makes text selection quicker and more accurate. There is also a text prediction feature that lets you flick predicted words upwards without having to move your thumbs away from the keyboard.

Powering the device is a relatively large 3,140 mAh battery and it also runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box. The bonus feature is that the PRIV comes with a host of BlackBerry productivity apps including a unified Hub. In terms of optics, the device features an 18-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS) and a dual-LED flash. It is also certified by Schneider-Kreuznach. Unfortunately, the PRIV only receives a 2-megapixel selfie-panorama front facing camera for selfies, which we’re sure may disappoint some. However, cameras aren’t all about optics, so we will have to see how good this 2MP shooter is. Many expect the PRIV to be a game changer as it is supposed to bring the best of both Android and BlackBerry operating systems together in a premium device. Well, it certainly has to be a game changer because BlackBerry CEO has stated that the company is relying heavily on the PRIV to do well for them to stay afloat.

Well, we thought so too. This magical ad triggers a pop up in search results and allows users to stream the application (for now it’s only for games) for up to 60 seconds. The purpose is to allow users to try out the application before deciding whether or not they want to download it. According to Google, one in four applications downloaded is never even used because of the shortening mobile attention span of the average user. Trial Run Ads attempts to curb that by letting users really get a feel of an application before downloading them, thus benefiting both the user and the app developer. This application is only in its beta stage though, but Google has unveiled this to app developers so the ball is in their court now and it is up to them to decide how to best utilise this feature. With proper and effective implementation, this looks like it could be a very interesting feature. Besides this nifty app Harry Potter-y, Google is also starting the beta for Interactive Interstitial ads that utilises HTML5 to create interactive mobile advertisements. It will let advertisers completely customise the advertisement to their liking and give them the freedom they need to use HTML5 instead of standard templates and pull data dynamically. It is truly customisable and can allow advertisers to include the app’s value proposition and functionalities to suit advertisers who are looking for higher user engagement."

In the face of heighten competition from its affordable Chinese rivals, they are continuing to grow from 3.9 million units shipped in Q1 this year to 4.7 million shipped in the last quarter. Driving the sales is their popular Charge and Surge, as they continue to increase its presence worldwide. According to IDC, the increase for Fitbit was also attributed to the rise of corporate wellness programs with large corporations providing Fitbit trackers for their staff.  With the entry of Apple Watch, the Cupertino company has managed to catapult itself to 2nd place, putting a dent to the market share of current wearable brands. In Q3, Apple has shipped 3.9 Watches, an increase of 300,000 over Q2 as it increased its availability to more market.

On the exterior, it gets a polished metal back and it uses a durable Kevlar fiber cable that’s wrapped in a braided sleeve.  For smartphone use, there’s a 3-button controller with a built-in mic attached to the right side cable.

Alexander Wong,Would you get the PRIV if it is slightly more expensive than the Note5?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/02/would-you-get-the-priv-if-it-is-slightly-more-expensive-than-the-note5/,"Android,blackberry,BlackBerry Android Device,blackberry malaysia,BlackBerry PRIV,BlackBerry PRIV Launch,BlackBerry PRIV Malaysia,BlackBerry PRIV Singapore,BlackBerry PRIV Singapore Price,smart phone","Android,BlackBerry,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-02,"The   has started rolling out internationally and those in Singapore will be getting it sometime next week. This is the BlackBerry’s first flagship to run on Android and it comes with its BlackBerry Torch-like slider keyboard. Available in retail stores and telcos from 12th December, the PRIV is priced at S$1,098 which converts to RM3,296. That’s slightly more than the Galaxy Note5 which was launched in the island state at S$1,088. Catching up since the BlackBerry Passport, the PRIV aims to stay relevant with updated hardware and a fresh user experience. It gets a 5.4″ AMOLED Quad HD screen with double curved edges and it runs on a more current Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. For storage it has 32GB on-board which is expandable with microSD.  Running on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with the possibility of being upgraded to Marshmallow early next year, the PRIV eliminates the concern of having limited apps with full access to the Google Play Store. With virtually all Android players adopting a full touch screen display, BlackBerry hopes to fulfill the needs of consumers that desire the tactile feel of a physical keyboard.  Given its retail price, the PRIV will face a tough challenge from likes of the Galaxy Note5, Xperia Z5 and even the Nexus 6P. After all, existing Android users will be their key focus group   to their Senior Director for Asia Pacific Product Management. The main deciding factor of course the slider keyboard. With the advancements of virtual keyboards such as SwiftKey and Swype, do you really need a physical keyboard in this day and age?  Given a choice between a BlackBerry PRIV and a Galaxy Note5, which smartphone would you get? The PRIV has passed our local   a while back and it shouldn’t take too long for BlackBerry to launch it in Malaysia."
Arif Lee,DirectD has begun selling the Xiaomi Mi Pad 2,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/02/directd-has-begun-selling-the-xiaomi-mi-pad-2/,"Android,DirectD,Malaysia,Mi Pad,Mi Pad 2,Mi Pad 2 DirectD,Mi Pad 2 Launch,Mi Pad 2 Malaysia,Mi Pad 2 Windows 10,Tablet,Windows 10,Xiaomi DirectD,Xiaomi Malaysia,Xiaomi Mi Pad,Xiaomi Mi Pad 2,Xiaomi Mi Pad 2 DirectD,Xiaomi Mi Pad 2 Malaysia","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-12-02,"All hail the existence of grey importers, allowing early adopters everywhere to get their hands on devices not readily available in their country of purchase. DirectD is a household name in our country and despite setting abhorrent prices on some of their inventory. ’s second iteration of a tablet, the  , meets the list and now has an all metal body – easily comparable to the iPad Mini 4. The model that’s available on DirectD’s website is the 16GB version, and they’ve priced it RM 899 (w/ GST). The colours on offer are Champagne gold and Dark grey. Jogging your memory on this tablet, it has a 7.9-inch screen plastered onto its metal build, the screen itself has a resolution of 2048 x 1536 (326 ppi). Lighter, thinner and overall smaller than its predecessor, it maintains the same screen size but shrinks down the bezels all around the screen. The Mi Pad 2, ditches the plastic yet weighs in at 322grams, when the model it replaces tips in at 360grams. The upgrades continue with an Intel chipset now at the helm, a 14nm 64-bit Atom X5-8500 to be precise. Its 16GB internal storage might set off some alarms with the omission of a microSD slot, especially those inclined to have most of their media with them on the go. For photography (if you’re seriously going to consider that with a tablet), it’ll get an 8-megapixel f/2.0 aperture lens on the rear, that will get you up to FHD video recording. As the front has a 5-megapixel lens, in case of those video calling moments or selfies (again, if you’re seriously considering doing that with a tablet). Two speaker grills will be found on the bottom rear and underneath its backing, there’s a 6190 mAh battery, smaller than before. Xiaomi however, promises it’ll get you 100 hours of music listening and almost 12 and a half hours of video watching. Charging the aforementioned battery will be the USB Type-C port and connector, while other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi; sadly, no 4G LTE support makes its way on this device. In terms of software, you’ll find MIUI 7 OS skin, as per usual. Xiaomi has plans on releasing a Windows 10 model soon, but we have no idea when it’ll be announced. Comparing prices abroad in the brand’s domestic market (China), the 16GB sells for roughly RM 662, that’s a RM 200+ premium, that you’re paying for. At the same time, the higher 64GB model retails for about RM 861, so think about that for a second.

What are we talking about? Well, the folks at   have decided it was a good idea to poke the metaphorical bear that is Apple, with their latest advert for an  /  Sandstone back case. Mmm, we love the smell of napalm in the morning. In their cheeky video – which looks like a parody of what we like to call the “swelling-music-advert” – OnePlus have painted themselves (or their users at least) as   who has got it “covered”, always ready and willing to help out their friends in need. In this case (ha ha), it would be OnePlus’ new friends over at Cupertino. As fun as this is, we certainly do hope OnePlus doesn’t think ALL its users dress like the guy in the video (that hat, really?). Just yesterday, OnePlus also posted a teaser on their Facebook page about their latest product, which I’m sure must’ve irked many an iPhone user now that the cat’s out of the bag. There is yet more evidence of this “friendly ribbing” on their product page as they strive to give iPhone 6/6s users the “Never Settle” feel, adding that its “sturdy, polycarbonate construction” adds both “grippiness and protection”. Apparently it’s one of those things “you won’t understand until you try it”. To sweeten the deal, OnePlus is throwing in a physical   invite with every purchase of this back case. That’s not all, the invites aren’t only invitations to buy the regular phone, but there is also a chance that you could get an invite to purchase the OnePlus X Ceramic or better yet, a free device. Now that sounds dandy and all but when we tried to purchase the case from their online store, a pop-up informed us that the case was currently out of stock, despite it being listed as in stock on the page itself. Maybe this is some kind of elaborate April fools prank in December. December Dummies perhaps?

If they keep the pricing in the same bracket as the previous Galaxy A series, we could have a serious contender in the low-to-midrange end of the smartphone market. The Galaxy A series consists of three phones, the  ,  , and   all bearing their new “6” badge that is supposed to represent 2016. We don’t know about you, but this peculiar badging just seems like another way to unnecessarily confuse prospective buyers. At first glance, all three devices share  ’s   flagship’s looks with a metal body sandwiched between two panels of glass. They also feature the rounded edges of the Galaxy S6 and pretty much the same layout we’ve grown to get used to for Samsung devices. All three devices will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. One thing that we were quite impressed with was the camera. All devices across the announced Galaxy A range feature a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture rear shooter and a 5-megapixel f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates them is that on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 both come bundled with optical image stabilisation (OIS) for their primary imaging unit. That’s pretty impressive for what looks to be mid-range devices. The best part? They all come in Pink Gold, so if you’ve ever wanted that colour but not the price tag it usually comes with, this could be your chance. That aside, the Galaxy A series begins with what looks like the entry-level Galaxy A3 sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) Super AMOLED display. The device would be powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz processor mated with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. This smartphone will also come with a 2,300 mAh battery. The Galaxy A3 will also have dual-SIM support, but it doesn’t appear to be a hybrid-SIM set up which means that you can have two SIMs and a microSD card. Other goodies include Cat.4 LTE connectivity support and 802.11 b/g/n WiFi. It also comes with Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, but no support for Samsung Pay. Moving up the pecking order comes the mid-range Galaxy A5. As the name implies, the Galaxy A5 is a step up from the Galaxy A3 and features a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage (also expandable via microSD up to 128GB). It is also bigger, with a 5.2” full-HD (1920×1080 pixels) Super AMOLED display. Powering it all will be a 2,900 mAh battery with fast charging. Connectivity options include Cat.6 LTE support, 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, this time with support for Samsung Pay. Perhaps one of the key features of this device is the fingerprint scanner, which is quite rare beyond the top end of the smartphone spectrum. Much like the Galaxy A3, the Galaxy A5 also has dual-SIM support. Sitting at the top of the range is the Galaxy A7, which is the largest device, featuring a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED panel. Under the hood, the smartphone will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 16GB but is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. It also has dual-SIM capabilities. Connectivity options are the same as the Galaxy A5, but the Galaxy A7 gets a bigger 3,300 mAh battery also with fast charging. Like its smaller brother the Galaxy A5, the Galaxy A7 also comes with a fingerprint scanner and support for Samsung Pay. Though the specific type of processor was not revealed, we have a hunch that it is Samsung’s Exynos processor. The first range of the Galaxy A smartphones were launched towards the end of 2014 and it was Samsung’s first attempt at truly bringing premium build quality to the masses. Before the Galaxy A series was launched, Samsung’s low end devices were all very plasticky and felt cheaply made, which felt like a rude reminder to all those who bought them to work harder. Now, with the rise of Chinese OEMs and their seemingly impossible smartphone value-for-money, especially in the lower end of the spectrum, the Korean electronics giant can’t afford to be complacent in their budget smartphones and risk giving up this lucrative section in the market. If the refreshed 2016 versions of the Galaxy A lineup are to be priced similarly to the previous Galaxy A lineup, we think that it could definitely be very competitive in that market. However, if Samsung prices these devices higher than their previous lineup, you’d be better off with a discounted Galaxy S6 instead. As a reference, when the original Galaxy A lineup was launched, the Galaxy A3 was priced at RM899, while the Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199, and the Galaxy A7 would set you back RM1,499. Bear in mind, these prices were before the implementation of GST and the falling ringgit. Of course, there are other good smartphones at this price bracket as well, such as the  , the   and the  . So the question is, do you buy into Samsung’s idea of a premium mid-range device? We’re pretty keen on these devices, what do you guys think? Let us know in the comments below."

We’d still think that driving an automobile is an experience best felt by being fully in control but they’re obviously perks to being able to have the ability to control your vehicle autonomously or through a remote. 
Pushing the boundaries of driving autonomously, the multi-talented UK based research team from Land Rover have been prototyping technology that allows you to move around your huge SUV or off-road beast, through fiddling with on-screen controls on your smartphone. 
Usher your Multi-point turn enabled Range Rover in a relatively controlled environment at a max speed of 4mph and manoeuvre your way through tight situations. Handing you controls for steering, breaks and accelerator, you’ll be able to be outside your car as you carefully move it around challenging terrain or hard to see parking situations – taking bad viewing angles out of the equation. 
Land Rover researchers also programmed the Multi-point turn technology to give those manning the virtual wheels the controls to adjust high and low range, angling the car in just the right manner to get around. It doesn’t stop there, as these in-built sensors on the car will apparently work in all weather conditions and environments, always enabling you to get yourself out of a tight spot, if need be. There are some limitations, such as range, when considering that you’ll only be able to “command” the car from a distance of 10 metres, all while your smartphone and smart keys are in close proximity. 
The team of researchers have also developed technology that allows you to turn your car a full 180-degrees in a tight spot; basically conducting a three-point turn. A much dreaded manoeuvre for anyone’s that has been in the driver seat of a large vehicle. Although other carmakers have already started implementing some of these options, it’ll be interesting to see how the idea of controlling your car from your smartphone’s will run along. It won’t please any motorheads but given the notion, it might be pretty cool."

Rory Lee,The 3x optical zoom ASUS ZenFone Zoom is now on sale in Taiwan,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/02/the-3x-optical-zoom-asus-zenfone-zoom-on-sale-in-taiwan/,"Android,Asus,ASUS Malaysia,ASUS ZenFone,ASUS ZenFone Zoom,asus zenfone zoom launch,camera,lumia 1020,Optical Zoom,smart phone,smart phone camera,smartphone,smartphone camera,smartphone with optical zoom,ZenFone Zoom,zenfone zoom launch,zenfone zoom launch taiwan,zoom lens","Android,Asus,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-02,"According to a report published in 2013, over   have only done so on a phone, not a traditional or standalone camera. That is a staggering number of people if you think about it, especially taking into consideration the keyword in that phrase is ‘ever’. Which means that, even two years ago, when smartphone cameras were arguably worse than they are now, people still defaulted to them for that snapshotting needs. This is completely understandable simply because a smartphone is more portable, usually cheaper and are just generally more convenient. Well,   hopes to add to that statistic with their latest  , which officially goes on sale in Taiwan today. One of the biggest problems was that most smartphones relied on a digital zoom, which is more like a fancy way to crop your photos if you think about it. The one you want to go for when zooming is the optical zoom, which adjusts the glass positioned in a camera/lens unit to reposition the light hitting the sensor, which brings the image closer but maintains its quality. Most smartphones shy away from using this because having multiple pieces of glass in the camera unit means having more space which in turn translates to a bigger camera hump. The supposedly brilliant thing about the ZenFone Zoom though is that it is the “world’s thinnest 3x-optical zoom smartphone”. How thin is thin? Well ASUS states that the ZenFone Zoom only has a 5mm edge. Bear in mind, this is the edge, and as the ZenFone line of devices have usually been curved at the back, this looks to be no exception. From the looks of it, the device’s camera unit does take up an enormous amount of space on the back panel ala- , but it doesn’t seem to protrude as much as the Lumia. In a device that is designed to take photographs, most of the actual photography will be taken by the primary 13-megapixel rear shooter while selfies and video chats will be handled by the device’s 5MP front facing unit. Other primary camera goodies include a dual-LED flash, laser autofocus, optical image stabilisation (OIS) and ASUS’ PixelMaster 2.0 camera technology that is designed to greatly improve low light photography, granting up to a 400% increase in brightness. For those curious about the PixelMaster 2.0 technology, we’ve already put it through its paces in our  . The ZenFone Zoom will also feature a dedicated shutter button, record button as well as a zoom rocker. Then again, we already expected most of this as the device was announced almost a year ago. What we do know now for sure now is that the device will come in 64GB and 128GB variants. Internal specs include an Intel Atom Z3580 quad-core processor clocked at 2.3GHz for the 64GB variant while the 128GB variant will be powered by a 2.5GHz Intel Atom Z3590 quad-core processor. Based on the website, it appears that the device will also come with 4GB of RAM and be powered by a 3,000 mAh battery with ASUS’ BoostMaster quick charging technology. The devices will also come running Android Lollipop out of the box. Display wise, the smartphone will come with a 5.5-inch full HD display with a pixel density of 403 ppi tucked away under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The body will also be of an aluminium unibody construction with what looks like a faux leather back to help with grip and texture as well as a ridge at the bottom of the phone to help with one handed photography. But we all know what a unibody means: no removable battery. It does have what looks like a lanyard port and appears to come bundled with a camera strap. The 64GB device retails in Taiwan for TWD13,990 (around RM1,806) while the 128GB will go for TWD15,990 (around RM2,065). While ASUS did not announce when this device will be available in other markets,   has hinted at an  , which means it could be any time now. The odd thing is that this device was announced a long time ago, and between its announcement and today ASUS has launched several devices already. This begs the question, what took them so long? Was there a massive kink in the device that delayed its launch this long? Let’s hope they’ve worked out whatever problems they had with it (if they had any problems) lest we have a repeat of  . We suspect this device will appeal to some camera enthusiasts who were interested in the Lumia 1020 but not the Windows Mobile platform. While it does seem that this device is a worthy Android equivalent, its sensor is but a measly 13-megapixels versus the Lumia 1020’s 41-megapixel monstrosity. Then again, megapixel isn’t the be-all and end-all of camera quality, so we will just have to wait and see."

Several years ago, the idea would be laughable, but today an Android smartphone could actually make or break this once dominate mobile brand. As BlackBerry continues to lose ground in smartphone  , they are pinning   hopes on the  . Their first Android device that comes with a slider keyboard.  The PRIV will be launched in Malaysia   and we’re lucky enough to get a brief hands-on with this new slider device.  At 5.4 inches, the PRIV is the largest smartphone BlackBerry has ever produced and the display features a double curve screen that’s very much like the S6 edge. Though the phone is not wrapped in metal, it does look premium enough for the business-centric user. The back has a grippy texture to it which gives it an assuring feel in the hands, but it took a little while to get used to. When held in the hands, it does have a nice heft to it and despite having a larger screen plus a sliding keyboard mechanism, it is lighter by a couple of grams than the  .  The sliding QWERTY keyboard is the main highlight of the PRIV, and the mechanism and the design are much improved from the old BlackBerry Torch. When sliding out, the PRIV feels slightly top heavy but it didn’t really bother us while typing. Having used a BlackBerry Bold previously, I found the keyboard to be enjoyable to use. Yes, you do type faster with on-screen keyboards with advance prediction technology but it doesn’t give the same tactile satisfaction as the real deal. Another advantage of using a slider keyboard is that you’ll have an unobstructed display to view your stuff since there’s no on-screen keyboard occupying half of the screen. Like the BlackBerry Passport, the keyboard has a couple of neat tricks. It also functions as a touchpad for scrolling and it makes text selection quicker and accurate.  There’s also a text prediction feature that was introduced on BlackBerry 10 and it lets you flick predicted words upwards without having to move your thumbs away from the keyboard. In terms of single-handed use, the width of the device is just right and you won’t struggle as much as the BlackBerry Passport that’s super wide.  If you’re not using a physical keyboard, the stock BlackBerry keyboard works just fine and you probably could install 3rd party ones like Swype or SwiftKey. I can imagine myself using the virtual keyboard more frequently for quick social updates, replies or while hooked up to a holder while driving.  In terms of performance, the PRIV that runs on Android 5.1.1 felt quite smooth and I didn’t experience any noticeable lags in the short time using it. The UI is very stock like and they do integrated a couple of native BlackBerry Apps including the unified BlackBerry Hub. If you’re using an Android device currently, you should feel quite at home but BB10 users might take a while to get used to it as   by their CEO John Chen. So is the BlackBerry PRIV the device to get? Probably the one and the only reason to consider is its physical keyboard. I love the feel of it, I really do and it is something that I find myself using regularly for writing stories or replying emails. But for other things when you just need to shoot a quick reply, the on-screen keyboard does the job just fine.  Knowing BlackBerry will definitely   at a premium, we struggle to justify why anyone should get it over the Galaxy Note5. In terms of hardware, the Quad HD display, Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage is pretty much mainstream. You could get that on the LG G4 that’s currently going for about RM2,299.  Of course, specs is just one factor to consider and the PRIV is also focused on privacy, which they are claiming to be the most if not one of the most secure Android smartphones in the market. Admittedly, I didn’t manage to explore other features such as the 18MP OIS-equipped camera and the DTEK security monitoring tool. Hopefully, we get to do so during the official local launch that’s happening on 8th December. Unless you’re getting this as a company phone, it is quite hard to justify paying more just the keyboard alone. Is there a genuine need for a physical QWERTY keyboard? Several Android brands have tried with the  ,   and the  , but most of them have ceased to exist. The recent attempt is by Samsung with its   for the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+, but with a less ideal implementation."

By making his own smartphone. An engineer by occupation, Andy Rubin has been around; he’s graced Car Zeiss, Apple, MSN, Google and of course, Android Inc. Interestingly, a report from The Information has the long lost granddaddy of all things Android calling for a recruitment drive for individuals to join his revisited escapade. A year plus after taking his leave from  , it’s apparent that his brainchild Playground Global will finally start giving back to his own causes. The aforementioned start-up by Rubin serves as a tech hatchery of sorts; enabling those wanting to start their own thing but don’t have the resources, mentorship and funding to make it happen. The Fund itself, managed to raise roughly US$ 300 million from investments by Google (no duh), Hewlett-Packard aka HP, Seagate and others. Leveraging on his venture capital experiences with Redpoint Ventures (where he is a partner), as for now, his cash flow has been streaming to artificial intelligence and smart home segments. Though the aforementioned report states that Rubin still sees the opportunity to enter the Android smartphone market. Folks at the Verge seems to think that the dynamics of the low to midrange market is too volatile to enter, with manufactures popping up every now and then. Thus, maybe his best bet is to make a premium device that’ll hope to take a slice away from the Apple pie. The inhibitors of Mountain View might have something to say about that, since Google themselves have been reported to be working on their own hardware; all the pieces seem to be lining up quite well for the former head of Android Inc. And a possible return to the smartphone scene might amount to a foreseeable re-entry at Google. Jumping at any opportunity to make something great, Rubin has touched the lives of many, even if we fail to realise it. As the master of surprises and all things Android, should we expect anything less from him?"

Captivating tech folks since coming into existence, the USB Type-C port is almost an all-in-one cable/head solution – beam pixels your display, transfer your data and charge up your power-hungry devices. So how does Thunderbolt 3 come into play? Well, utilisation of USB Type-C protocols and Thunderbolt 3 technology will in theory allow data transfers up to 40Gbps (giga bits per second), doubling what we’ve seen on Thunderbolt 2 ports, and quadrupling speeds on USB 3.1. That roughly translates to an uncompressed RAW 4K video (1 hour long) sizing in at 158.2GB transferring around 30 seconds – working out to 5GBps. Talking about driving pixels on screen, it’ll also be capable of displaying two 4K-resolution screens up to a 60Hz refresh rate at the same time and quicken charging for notebooks up to 100 watts. Setting a platform for other types of protocols like DisplayPort, Super Speed USB and PCIExpress, Intel will bank on Thunderbolt to gain traction, as it hasn’t really caught on for most users; except those tech-centric folks out there needing more from their ports. Already realised on smartphones like the OnePlus Two (but don’t use their cables, read about that here), Xiaomi’s Mi 4c, Lumia 950 series, latest Nexuses, PCs and tablets, we hope that USB Type-C catches on quickly.

Making inlays into the higher-end market by imploring classier materials like metal, as seen by Huawei and Xiaomi, Vivo hasn’t been left in the dust, releasing the X6 and X6 Plus in light of the current trend. Specs are king though the new duo might have something to say about that, taking a look under their hoods. Let’s start with the smaller X6, that carries a 5.2-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display. Under that screen, sits a 1.7GHz MediaTek MT6752 Octa-core processor, mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory. It is made from anodised aluminium and going through 57 steps before getting laser engraved and well deserved polish. Other stock internals include the 13-megapixel sensor on the rear, while sitting under it, is a square cut out, where you’ll find the fingerprint scanner. The rear lenses on both devices will be equip with Phase Detection auto-focus, HDR and a f/2.2 aperture sensor. As a quick flip to the front will reveal the 8-megapixel shutter on the top of the screen. It’ll also natively support a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slot, that allows you to swap up the second SIM for a microSD card. The two devices are quite similar, only altering by screen size, internal storage and battery size. That said, the larger X6 Plus has a 5.7-inch screen of the same resolution, while its internal memory gets bumped up to 64GBs. The smaller of the two will carry a 2,400 mAh battery and the vivo X6 Plus will don a 3,000 mAh battery. Vivo’s X6 has a footprint of 147.9 x 73.8 x 6.6mm, as its larger sibling doesn’t pay heed to its dimensions on vivo’s website. Both devices will fun Funtouch OS on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop and retail for the following prices: 2,600 RMB (RM 1,721) – vivo X6 and 3,200 RMB – vivo X6 Plus (RM 2,118). We’re not entirely convinced that people will pick up the device, considering other household names that sell their mid-range devices for roughly the same price. For now this Apple look-alike will only be exclusively sold in China beginning the 7  of December. Then again, all smartphones pretty much have some form of resemblances with one another – or maybe that’s just our opinion."

According to the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), this update was not initiated by the app maker and has been infecting Android devices in Singapore over the past few months. After the “update” has been downloaded, the malware will prompt the user to enter confidential information, such as credit card details. Then the malware would take over the affected device and intercepts the one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS to the phone for committing fraudulent transactions. “Criminals have been targeting computer users, but now criminals have turned to targeting Android phone users as banks are pushing out more banking apps for user convenience,” said ABS director Ong-Ang Ai Boon. It turns out convenience really is becoming the downfall of humanity as we continuously rely on our devices to carry out daily activities. According to Channel NewsAsia, this vulnerability extends beyond just WhatsApp as they claim the malware is disguising itself as an operating system update as well. They reported that about 50 smartphone users have been hit by malware targeting mobile banking customers in the last three months. Besides disguising itself as a WhatsApp update, it also reportedly masquerades as an operating system update for the battery management module. Channel NewsAsia also reports that ABS estimates the average amounts lost by the victims who are customers of major retail banks in Singapore were “a couple of hundred of dollars”, although some victims could have lost several thousand dollars through multiple transactions. The source of these fraudulent transactions appear to originate from Eastern Europe and includes purchases of budget airline tickets. “Jailbroken iPhones or rooted Android [devices] are vulnerable…and in particular Android, because that phone system involves easier download of third-party apps,” said Ong-Ang. The silver lining is that ABS states that banks may refund victims on a case-by-case basis depending on whether or not the victim took the necessary precautions to protect themselves from such attacks. Singapore is awfully close to our home soil of Malaysia, so please be warned and double check your updates before installing them. At the time that this article was written, there has been no official announcement on this matter posted on WhatsApp’s Facebook page, Twitter or Blog. So the moral of the story here is, please make sure that your application updates come directly from the Google Play Store."

Well, they certainly weren’t kidding when they said it was designed specifically for the 4G LTE user. Hotlink FAST’s starter pack is priced at RM15 and it comes with RM5 preloaded airtime, 300MB preloaded high-speed Internet and offers users a choice of three internet passes. The first plan gives users a 2GB quota for 30 days, then the second plan doubles that up to 4GB and finally the third plan is sort of a “lite” version where it gives users 500MB for 7 days. Call rates are the same across all plans at 6sen/30sec to your ACTIV10 (10 Hotlink/Maxis numbers) and 12sen/30sec to all local networks. SMS is rated at 1sen/SMS to your ACTIV10 contacts and 12sen/SMS to all local networks. Users can also apply for an add-on of either 1GB (RM12), 500MB (RM8), or 300MB (RM5) that will last the duration of your quota cycle. On the website, it states that there will be “No credit drain” and that the “Internet will stop its service once the FAST Internet pass expires.” However, Hotlink informs us that one the quota has been finished, you can still surf the Internet, but at a throttled speed of 64kbps. They explained that although the quota was split between 4G LTE and non-4G LTE speeds, once a user depletes their designated 4G quota, they can continue surfing at 4G speeds but this time it will draw from their “All Networks” quota instead. Unfortunately, the inverse is not true. This means that if you were in a location without 4G LTE coverage, you can only use the “All Networks” quota, which is half of what you are actually paying for. Now we understand that to create a “competitive” plan, compromises have to be made, but surely this doesn’t make any sense. Why would Hotlink want to segregate quota by network type? This just seems like a major inconvenience to the consumer. Perhaps this is a testament to  , but even that seems like a stretch to try and justify their actions. In any case the plans themselves, if you ignore the split quota, is quite reasonable. So, if you have faith in Maxis’ network coverage and would like to sign up for this plan, existing Hotlink users can do so via the Hotlink RED app by going to ‘My Account’ and selecting ‘Change’ next to ‘Rateplan’. Alternatively they can dial *100*6*1# from their mobile devices."

Brimming on the fastest 4G LTE award given by Ookla and wanting to show appreciation to their customers, U Mobile will be handing out the aforementioned data free of charge to its customers only for the month of December. Though the only catch is you’d have to be on an existing U Mobile data plan. Extending across all its data services and customers; no matter if you’re on prepaid, postpaid or their broadband plans. As per minimum, for prepaid any UMI or iPlan will make you eligible for this special offer. Postpaid customers, just ensure you’re on the U28, P50 or P70, iPlans or UD plans. Lastly, broadband users on the MB Plan will be allocated the same free 1GB of data. The data will be bundled with your existing package, so there’s no nonsense about using this quota before getting the additional 1GB, not that it matters in the first place. Bear in mind that this is only a year end promo, so your extra 1GB of free data will only last you until New Year’s Eve aka 31st of December, 2015 only. To check up if you’ve actually received the data, you can refer to your UMB, SMS and U Mobile app. It’s no question that the orange telco learnt a thing or two from Digi’s offer that required customers to “activate” their free data, after their network outage – so kudos U Mobile for making it easier for your customers.

Speedtest has finally revealed the numbers along with the rank of our current fixed and mobile operators in the country. Full details after the break.  Starting with mobile networks that are running on 4G LTE, U Mobile is ranked #1 with an average download speed of 22.58Mbps with uploads of 10.34Mbps. Following in 2nd place is Celcom with 19.46Mbps downloads and Maxis holding on to third place at 18.20Mbps. Meanwhile, Digi takes the last place at 17.49Mbps.   For fixed broadband, TM takes up the Top 3 which is a mixture of various identifiers that lead back to Telekom Malaysia. Looking at the speeds, it is safe to assume that all 3 listings are predominantly Unifi subscribers on the highest 20Mbps Unifi plan. This is then followed by Maxis and YTL Communications, that operates Yes 4G WiMAX. Surprisingly Time Broadband didn’t make the list and we feel they could be among the Top 5 if it wasn’t for TM’s duplicated entries.  To recap on the  , Speedtest measures the average performance of each telco based on the fastest technology possible which is 4G LTE. So in theory, this wouldn’t take into account of speedtests conducted on 3G and on older non-LTE enabled devices. For fixed broadband ISP, the performance is calculated based on the top 10% of each network’s speedtest results. This according to Speedtest is to accurate represent customers that subscribe to the highest tier/package offered by the ISP.  While 4G telcos are   the widest, fastest and best network, Speedtest is probably the best independent indicator for now. Another glaring difference between Malaysia versus other countries is that our mobile telcos are delivering faster speeds than our fixed broadband providers. In most cases, the fixed broadband providers in US, Canada, UK and Australia are clocking around 100Mbps or at least 2-3X faster than their fastest 4G operators. So what do you guys think of the verdict?"

I completely understand this desire to milk every last drop out of your prized cow simply because money is hard to make in this world where piracy is rampant. Generally, many of these spin-offs tend to fall flat and the way I see it, there are two big reasons why this happens. The first is that the show doesn’t live up to the hype. It’s hard to follow in the footsteps of something as big as, say,   for example (we’re looking at you  ). Secondly, it doesn’t eventually break off from the original and find and identity of its own, or that special niche that makes a show special. In the world of smartphones, it seems, that there exists this same desire to spin off into various other versions of an OEM’s flagship or popular device. Some spin-offs are designed to make their flagship devices more accessible with lower price points by omitting one or two key features but keeping the feel the same.

The internet is full of vulnerabilities and even our smart phones isn’t spared from exploits. Having your data stolen is not funny but you can take action now with Zipit Chat. Using a globally recognised encryption system, it gives you a peace of mind when communicating with your peers. So how does Zipit Chat work? Read on to find out. Zipit Chat is currently available for Android devices and you can download it directly from the  . For new users, activation is as easy as entering your mobile number and enter the verification code that’s sent to you. You’ll receive a unique Zipit ChatID that looks like a BlackBerry PIN and you can set your password between 6-16 digits.  Once that’s out of the way, you can start inviting your family and friends from your contact list. There are plenty of instant messaging apps out there but nobody does security better than Zipit Chat. Encrypted with AES 256 technology, your messages are impossible for anyone to intercept which gives you a true end to end encryption.  When transmitting sensitive information such as password, pins or confidential information, you can set a Self-Destruct Timer from 30 seconds up to 10 minutes. For an extra layer of security, Zipit Chat even disables your phone screenshot function, so that nobody could snap a copy of it.  Emails are still relevant these days and for business users, there are messages that are highly P&C. We’ve heard stories of email accounts being hacked and if it does happen to you, Zipit Chat can keep your email threads secured with the same military grade encryption. The content will be scrambled including its attachments and only the intended sender and recipient can view it fully via Zipit Chat.  If you’re unconvinced, Celcom had earlier issued a challenge for anyone to decrypt 3 messages that are encrypted by Zipit Chat and nobody has managed to crack it so far. So even if some snooping agency or hackers have gain access to your inbox, it would take probably years to figure it out by brute force.  Most people would have different logins and passwords for various accounts including online banking. If you find it hard to keep track of all of them, you jot them down safely under Zipit Chat’s Secure Notes. Similar to its email feature, it scrambles your note into a bunch of unreadable text, thus ensuring only you are able to read it.  While it is not recommended to store passwords on your phone, at least you know there’s a safer way to keep from prying eyes.  Having your phone stolen is bad enough and the last thing you want is to have your personal data stolen. With Zipit Chat, your messages, notes and emails are always password protected at all times. When left inactive, it will constantly require your pin number to launch the app. For another layer of secrecy, there’s a rather clever Stealth Mode which removes the Zipit Chat icon completely from your smart phone. To access the app again, just dial #*# followed by your pin number and then hit the call button."

However, clearly pushing into the mobile sector proved difficult even for the telco giant, so TM have instead decided to take baby steps and only start user trials and network readiness tests come December. However, according to TM group chief executive officer Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, development of Telekom Malaysia’s overall LTE network rollout is on track, with the core LTE network being managed and planned for future growth by  . “We are now building on that core to roll out nationwide, starting with urban areas and adjacent to existing base stations,” said Zamzamzairani. This isn’t TM’s first foray into the LTE technology as they had launched their very own LTE-based 4G broadband service,   back in August of last year. TMgo was launched while the TM-P1 partnership was still pending approval, so it ran at a lower 850MHz frequency instead of the usual 1800MHz/2600MHz bands used by mainstream 4G operators. Now, with the full support of P1 at their backs, TM can really flex its muscles and push their way into the four-horse race. As with any industry, having more competition will only be beneficial for the consumer. With more competition, telcos have to tread carefully to keep their services relevant and avoid being run over by competition. With a major telecommunications player like TM entering the mobile services scene, you can expect the existing players who are currently locked in a four-way-free-for-all for LTE supremacy, to scramble and make sure the upstart new challenger doesn’t take their crown away from them. In any case, if TM successfully makes their way into the mobile sector, it can only mean good things for us consumers. We can realistically expect more competitive pricing,   and probably a whole lot more drama."

Spending all your hard earned money on a fake device has to be one of the most heartbreaking things ever, so   Malaysia teamed up with the Ministry of Domestic Trade Co-operatives and Consumerism (KPDNKK) to crack down on these counterfeit bandits. On the 20th of November at 11am, the operation began and both OPPO Malaysia and KPDNKK raided two locations, Plaza Alam Sentral in Shah Alam as well as Terminal 1 in Seremban. KPDNKK’s Intellectual Property Enforcement Division head Othman Nawang said that based on the information and intelligence gathered during the KPDNKK’s investigation, they had conclusive evidence to carry out the raid on these two locations suspected of selling counterfeit OPPO products. Sure enough the raid was a success as the joint task force uncovered 8 counterfeit devices worth over RM4,200. This may only seem like a fraction of the earlier reported 644 counterfeit devices, but at least these are devices that people haven’t spent their hard earned money on, so at it’s a start if nothing else. Among the phones confiscated, were fake versions of the OPPO Find 7 and OPPO N3. Othman said that the ministry had sent out recon teams to investigate the two locations and they found that these counterfeit devices were being sold between RM400 and RM700, which is a stark contrast to their original price range of RM1,000 to RM2,098. According to OPPO Overseas Customer Service manager Boyce Lee, this was the first raid to crack down on counterfeit phones conducted by KPDNKK. “Ever since we received reports in early January, we have been in close contact with the Ministry to further strike down these counterfeiting activities,” he said. “We have brought this to the Ministry’s attention that the circulation of counterfeit products are getting worse with each passing day and we seek legal actions to be taken by the authority.” Boyce added that to the layman, the counterfeit products’ design were almost indistinguishable from original OPPO products, but the devices’ poor design quality and unstable features tainted the OPPO name. He added that there was a possibility that the cheap parts used could have direct harmful or toxic effects on the user."

When it comes to actual usage, speed is probably more important in our current connected age.  So who is the fastest? A popular internet speed testing tool has just named Malaysia’s fastest mobile network and the winner might surprise you. 
 U Mobile, Malaysia’s youngest mobile telco was just awarded the Fastest Mobile Network in the country by Ookla’s Speedtest. An impressive feat considering U Mobile is the last among the 4 telcos  . Despite not having extensive 4G coverage, U Mobile is capable of delivering high-speeds up to 42Mbps with its   network.  We’ve mentioned   that the current 4G coverage race is getting rather silly. Any telco can throw numbers but ultimately what does it mean to the average consumer? For example, when Digi reclaimed the widest 4G LTE title, they   that customers can expect 5Mbps speeds on 4G and more than 15Mbps on 4G LTE-A. Those numbers are low for 4G standards and they are already achievable with current 3G technologies. After all, it is not what you have, but what you do with it.  At the moment, Ookla has yet to publish the full Malaysian report on their   page but we assume that they used the same methodology here as other countries. The results are derived from the average performance recorded on the fastest technology possible which is 4G. Each test are aggregated by averaging each user’s test result at several locations each day. This prevents manipulation of repeated speedtests by a handful of users from affecting the overall result.

They’ve been milking eager fans by a pretty margin but all is fair when it comes to grey importers, we suppose.   The aforementioned page that went up on vmall.my listed the device will be on sale for RM 2,698 (w/ GST) for the 64GB model; which is equally stacked against another Huawei device, the   (64GB). Easily pointing to the manufacturer not wanting to bite themselves in the butt by selling the Nexus at a lower price, to keep some emphasis on their other smartphones. Playing down the state of our currency, it’s likely the heighten pricing is to leave some leeway for the Ringgit to continue to fluctuate. Taking into consideration that the 32GB Nexus 6P sells for US$ 499 (RM 2,128) and the 64GB model goes for US$ 549 (RM 2,341) in the US.

Internal memory options were listed above, while it’ll carry 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM for multitasking and app switching. In terms of photography, there will be a 12.3-megapixel sensor on the rear that’s equip with 1.55 micron pixels and an aperture of f/2.0 for those low light situations. Accompanying the camera module will be a dual-tone LED and laser auto focus as well. Taking a look at the front, an 8-megapixel f2.4 shutter will greet you near the top; this sensor will carry a 1.4-micron pixel size. For audio, it’ll boast dual front facing stereo speakers on the top and bottom, while Huawei also deploys USB Type-C for data and charging utilisation. The port itself, will help charge up the 3,450mAh battery that’s inside, while   the future-proof port will help bring it up to speed, just a little quicker – only on particular   though; nope those Quick Charge 2.0 charging heads won’t be of any use.

Many owe this bad performance to the OEM’s disappointing 2015 flagship the   and how HTC didn’t go back to the drawing board when developing it. Perhaps it was because they were stubborn, or perhaps it was because of a lack of communication between the company and their customers that put them in this predicament. Well, HTC must’ve figured it was the latter because the smartphone manufacturer just announced that they are opening up the HTC Preview Program to all in the hope that it would help them better understand what exactly their customers want. In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on social, news and entertainment aggregation website Reddit, HTC’s USA Preview Team announced their intention to find a new way to connect back to the Android community, as well as answer any questions the community might have about this program. In a nutshell, this program will allow HTC fans to get their hands on the company’s latest software and hardware before it is released, in exchange for daily use and feedback. Yes, hardware too. In the   hosted on the Preview website, it is stated that while those selected to participate in this program will occasionally require participants to use their own devices, depending on the specific HTC Preview projects, the OEM may also provide loaner devices too. It seems like a good opportunity to get your hands on some unreleased HTC hardware. Of course, as the primary purpose of this program is to identify daily user habits, user information and feedback has to be collected by the company. However, HTC has clarified that while there will be logs running in the background to collect data on network/signal strength, battery information, usage times and apps used, they will not collect any sensitive personal data or tell what you are looking at on your screen unless you explicitly take a screenshot to share with them. They also clarified that one of the reasons they have opened up the HTC Preview program is to have actual hard facts and feedback on what their users want. This is so that they have actual data backing them when they tell executives what their customers want, which in turn makes it easier to have an impact on change within the company. HTC also reassured the community that they will take the feedback from this program very seriously and will tweak their upcoming devices to improve based on that information. They also added that if feedback for a device is overwhelmingly negative, they would even use that information to evaluate a product’s release. This is a very bold move by HTC, bringing what looks like, on the surface at least, more transparency to their product development. It should also ignite a warm fire in the hearts of HTC fans who have been clamouring for their voices to be heard and who are passionate about helping the company grow past these hard times. However, as this has only just been launched, the actual effectiveness of this program remains to be seen. They could just be all talk and have no action. For whatever it’s worth, let’s hope this does help them get back on its feet because it would be such a shame if the company, which had brought us one of the most beautiful metal unibody designs, fell out of the race. For those of you who are interested, you can also participate in the HTC Preview program, just head on over to   and follow the instructions there."

Once 2016 hits, you’re going to be out and about again, taking all life gives you. Jostling between your work and play is already tough to begin with but with a premium pocket companion like the Galaxy S6 edge+, it’ll get easier.

Captivate friends and family with its QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED screen, as you browse through shopping lists, and let them notice the nimbleness of the package. You’ll notice the dual-edged display immediately and it offers some great functionality too, making sure your loved ones are just a tap away. Measuring at 154 x 75.8 x 6.9mm, it has a small footprint for a device with such a large screen, while only weighing 153grams.

The front sensor will hold its ground too with selfies abundant during the festive period, though some might not be as lucky; having to spend this season apart, due to unforeseen circumstances – fret not, the 5-megapixel lens allows 4K video recording, so no pixelated videos during sharing. All that moving around while recording or taking photos during parties won’t hamper the main camera either, since it comes with optical image stabilisation (OIS); there’s also HDR (high dynamic range) on board the two cameras, so the objects and backgrounds of your pictures will have just the right mix of exposure, giving you the best photo. Share all the splendour with its wide array of connectivity options; you’ll find 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.0 and the works on board, never leaving you in a spot with cellular reception (unless it’s your telco coverage). The device will charge up quickly too, with Samsung’s own fast charge technology on the 3000 mAh battery. You can ditch cables too, if you have the supported Qi Wireless charging dock."

UMNO lawmaker Datuk Raime Unggi said in Parliament today that Malaysian dependency on navigation apps to find their way around the maze-like labyrinth of Kuala Lumpur’s bustling city centre, was possibly exposing our country to “external threats” from foreign countries. The Tenom MP proceeded to elaborate that this was because when users use these applications for location searching, it indirectly provides information about Malaysia to external quarters such as the United States and Israel. The reason he cited these two countries, we assume, is because Google is headquartered in the US while Google owned Waze was developed in Israel. Kuala Selangor MP Datuk Irmohizam Ibrahim said that our nation cannot compromise when it comes to national security. He also brings up the issue about the extent to which our laws could protect such information leaks. “How far do we have laws that prevent information leaks in the usage of Google Map(s) and Waze?” he asks the Parliament. “Are there laws to make sure national security protected in the usage of such apps?” Communications and Multimedia Deputy Minister Datuk Jailani Johari reassured the concerned MPs that it was up to the users to decide how much personal information they wished to share and that they could choose to stop using the apps if they disagreed with the privacy policies. Jailani adds that the apps function based on privacy policies that are agreed upon by the individual and the application provider, be it Waze or Google Maps. If the user decides that they do not want to continue using the service, they can terminate the agreement and the provider will no longer hold on to their data. “We have yet to receive any report on any apps used for spying purposes. ‘The real issue is that our users are fond of over-sharing private information on the Internet. This results in the information being misused. As a smart internet user, we should have our own controls,” said Jailani, who is also the MP for Hulu Terengganu. Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed also downplayed the danger claimed to be posed by the navigation applications, saying that these applications have helped citizens navigate more than it helps terrorists. He did however say that he acknowledges the security concerns, but he feels that the pros outweigh the cons. Kuala Krai MP Dr Mohd Hatta Ramli raised another concern that if the government decides to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) it could give foreign countries access to Malaysian personal data collected by the aforementioned navigation applications. “Our personal data used to be kept within the borders of the country,” he said. “Now with TPP, we must not allow it to be taken out of the county. We have a lot personal data that we would not like to share with other people.”. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a 12-nation free trade agreement backed by the United States which is set to be debated in Malaysia in January next year. Opposition MP for Kelana Jaya Wong Chen said that the free trade treaty required Malaysia to allow transfer of electronic information to foreign countries. “TPP prohibition on data localisation laws (Article 14.13) essentially means personal info that is hosted abroad would be subject to different laws on privacy,” he said. Wong further explained that under this, your personal data could be subjected to US surveillance laws such as the US Patriot Act, instead of our own privacy laws."

The Mate 8 will be another aluminium unibody device that has come from the Chinese manufacturer but it’ll carry the newly released processor from their subsidiary Kirin, promised to blow away any of the current SoCs out there. Taking a close-up look at the 950 processor, it’s an Octa-core chipset that runs 4 cores at 2.3GHz and 4 other cores clocked to 1.8GHz. The manufacturer says that through the new “i5” coprocessor, the device will have a better power management system and allow speech recognition as well. Underneath along with the processor, are a combination of either 3GB RAM/32 GB internal storage, 4GB/64GB or 4GB/128GB, depending which model that you fancy. The 6-inch screen will run a native 1920 x 1080 resolution, and feature 2.5D curved glass from edge to edge all around the display. You won’t find much else on the front, aside from the 8-megapixel camera near the top. Moving onto the rear, there will be a fingerprint sensor located a step below the Sony IMX298 16-megapixel rear lens module. Huawei is finally migrating to Android’s new OS, Marshmallow, in the form of a EMUI 4.0 skin and feature a huge 4,000 mAh battery. Once it hits it’ll be available in 4 colours; Champagne Gold, Moonlight Silver, Space Grey and Mocha Brown. Retail price is set to 3,199 RMB (RM 2,118), 3,699 RMB (RM 2,449) and 4,399 RMB (RM 2,912)  – based on the memory configurations we’ve listed out earlier. You’ll have to wait till Q1 of next year before it arrives in stores for the international market, while it is readily available in China already. The prices seem daunting for something that would come from the smartphone manufacturer but it seems that they want to step up their quality and prices have to reflect that – compared to last year’s Ascend Mate 7, it gets a RM 1k price jump but will consumer bite? We’re not too sure, as of now. Huawei says we should expect the Mate 8 to be announced for the international market during CES this coming January, so stay tuned once the New Year arrives."
Rory Lee,6 Tips to stay connected during floods,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/26/6-tips-to-stay-connected-during-floods/,"banjir,CFM,flood,Flooding,Malaysia Flood,MCMC,mobile tips during floods,poor signal during floods,tips during flood",Industry in General,2015-11-26,"The rainy season is in full effect now with many parts of the country experiencing constant downpour each day. And with the tide phenomenon that is expected to occur in the Straits of Tebrau from the 24th to 30th of November is likely to mean more trouble for affected locals. Malaysia has had its fair share of flood woes in the past and since it’s the rainy season again, the folks at Communications and Multimedia Consumer Forum of Malaysia (CFM) have decided to take a more proactive role to ensure effective communication during these potentially trying times remains strong. CFM have sent us a long list of tips that are designed to help the public better manage as well as communicate more effectively during times of emergency. We at SoyaCincau.com value your time and as a result have condensed their tips for your convenience. Here are the 6 communication tips during floods:   CFM strongly urges the public to be patient when communicating. If your call or msg is unable to get through to the other person, wait awhile before trying again. The communication infrastructure is put under a lot of stress during times of emergency and can get congested due to the high volume of messages. So, if everyone incessantly tries to communicate, it becomes less likely that any messages will get through at all. It’s sort of like traffic congestion, really. If everyone leaves their office at 6pm, then nobody would be getting anywhere anytime soon.   We know some of you have completely abandoned the SMS service, because frankly who needs it when you have free messaging applications like Whatsapp? But, CFM advises users to use this ‘retro’ form of communication during emergencies because they take up less bandwidth and will put a lighter load on the communication system. If we were to build on our traffic jam analogy, a call would be that large BMW 750Li, while a text message would only be a little Vespa zipping along between traffic.   Needless to say, without power, that flagship smartphone you paid thousands of ringgit for is about as useful as a brick. Probably less useful since its so light and thin, so CFM encourages its consumers to charge up your devices and power banks when there is power. That way, if and when the power goes down, you will still have enough juice to keep your phones running. Of course, saving power also means using your devices less often. Save them for emergencies and only use them when you absolutely have to, not to post a selfie on Instagram. If your device has power saving mode, it is recommended to enable it to extend its battery life.    Speaking of Instagram, CFM implores everyone to limit their online activity to avoid coverage congestion. Actions like uploading photos, videos or sharing voice clips on social media consumes a lot of bandwidth and by now we’re sure you all know what that means. Yep, you guessed it, congestion. 10 points to Gryffindor!   We’ve all seen disaster movies. We’ve all seen the scene where the protagonists are trapped in a danger zone and are waiting by the radio with bated breath for information that could very well save them. Well, it turns out there is some truth in those scenes as CFM says that it becomes an important source of news during an emergency. However, they have stated that consumers should ensure that they have an adequate battery supply before doing so. You can also get the latest updates from local emergency response services or RELA members so it’s a good idea to keep their contact handy.   Well, keep calm. There really is no use in panicking during an emergency.   CFM informs us that they aren’t sitting on their hands at their end either. The Ministry of Communications and Multimedia (KKMM) and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) are working with all Telecommunications Service Providers (SPs) to provide temporary base communication station towers at several affected areas as a support to enhance the coverage during floods or natural disasters. However, they did add that priority will be given to places that are in need of it the most. They also ask for your understanding that natural disasters can cause unavoidable damage to infrastructure in affected areas which would result in less than stellar coverage. Teamwork is key in these situations so do be considerate and work together to overcome times of emergency."
Rory Lee,OnePlus offering refunds for their problematic USB Type-C cables,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/27/oneplus-offering-refunds-for-their-problematic-usb-type-c-cables/,,,2015-11-27,"Awhile back,   came under fire from critics and the tech community in general when it was discovered that their  . This could possibly lead to damage if used with any device other than the  . Leading the charge was Google employee Benson Leung who had embarked on a crusade to purge the world of non-compliant USB Type-C cables. His method involved ordering cables off Amazon then testing them to see if they met the USB standards. When he arrived at the OnePlus cable, he found that even a cable manufactured by a proper smartphone manufacturer did not meet proper USB Type-C standards. Needless to say, the Caped Cable Crusader rained sweet justice down on the Chinese manufacturer, bringing them to their knees (metaphorically speaking, of course). Yesterday, OnePlus finally caved and admitted that their cables were indeed non-compliant, but it seems the USB Vigilante still isn’t entirely satisfied. OnePlus graciously accepted Benson and the community’s criticism, openly admitting on their official forum that their USB Type-C cables and adapters were using a 10kΩ resistor instead of the 56kΩ resistor detailed in version 1.1 of the USB Type-C port standard. This message came straight from the top, no less. According to the post, the issue with resistors was that the cables and adapter were only designed for a maximum of 2 amps of power, which is how much the OnePlus 2’s charger supports. However, when used on other devices that allow fast-charging, the resistor will let the devices try to draw more power than a power source may allow. Ultimately, this could result in damage to said power source (such as 3rd-party cables, USB ports, etc.) if they do not have an internal mechanism to self-regulate the amount of power flowing to or from them. OnePlus added that typically, if a charger has the CE, UL, or CCC markings, it should be certified and safe to use. The OEM also compiled their findings into a simple and easy-to-understand table detailed below: Unfortunately for OnePlus though, it appears that they didn’t get everything right. Ah Benson, do keep up the good work! In any case, OnePlus is offering a refund on the affected products purchased through the OnePlus website. Do note though that the cables that came bundled in the box with your OnePlus 2 will not be eligible for a refund. This is simply because OnePlus remains firm in saying that the cables and adaptors are entirely safe to use with the OnePlus 2 and that the problem was compatibility with other devices. Based on the post, the refund appears to only be available for customers in North America, Europe, India and China, and will only be offered by OnePlus until the end of December this year. For those of you thinking of cashing in to get some cables at discounted Black Friday prices and then getting a full priced refund for them, tough luck, because it appears that both the cable and the adapter are out-of-stock on the OnePlus website."

This was to eliminate what Google called “screenshot jujitsu” and help the app better compete with other navigation applications like Here Maps as well as standalone navigation systems. Although the roll-out had officially begun, offline support for many parts of the world, including Malaysia, was still missing. Finally, after much anticipation, the application supports offline navigation within our home soil. With this feature, users can expect an improved navigation experience using the Maps app especially in areas where connectivity is bad, or when you want to save those precious few bytes of your quota. Google employs two different uses for their new offline navigation feature. The first is to bolster online navigation with the app, when connectivity is spotty at best, allowing Maps to freely switch between offline and online mode ensuring that you don’t lose crucial navigation information just because you entered an area with bad coverage. The second method is where users can opt to switch off connectivity completely and rely on the app to navigate with the pre-downloaded offline areas. To download an area, simply key in the location (or tap and hold a point on the map) and swipe up on the card that appears at the bottom. Then, select ‘download’ on the resulting screen, specify your desired region and tap the download button once more. Downloaded maps are stored on your device, so remember to free up some space before you decide to give this feature a spin. As an estimate, the amount of space required to download the greater area of Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur is about 300MB, whereas if you want offline navigation for Peninsular Malaysia, you will need to free up at least 1.5GB of space. Offline maps can be kept on your device for a total of 30 days. By default, stored locations will be updated via WiFi but that can be changed in the offline areas settings to allow for updates to be downloaded over a mobile network or to not be updated at all. This is definitely a bold move by Google, stepping into the world of offline navigation, but whether this move will pay off remains to be seen. Do give this feature a try the next time you need to navigate in unfamiliar territory, then let us know what you think of it in the comment section below. Does it stack up to already established offline navigation applications like Here Maps?"

Featuring twin batteries of the same capacity – 3,010 mAh, it also supports reverse through charging, so if your friend or family member is in a fix, just use the Marathon M5 to give their devices a quick charge up. The manufacturer claims that with the total 6,020 mAh of battery capacity, the device will get you up to 4 days of regular usage – roughly translating to a claimed 62 hours of talk time and 682 hours of standby time. And if that isn’t enough for you power hungry users, its extreme mode will give you another 62 hours of standby time at 5% battery; typically stripping you of everything except the bare essentials for the smartphone to receive calls and texts, probably. Other internals include a lowly 1.5GHz Quad-core MediaTek MT6735 processor, a HD (1280 x 720) AMOLED screen and 3GB of RAM with 32GB of internal memory to go along with it. You’ll also find Gionee’s Amigo 3.1 skin over Android 5.1 Lollipop on this device, that’s capable of 4G LTE through its dual-SIM slots. An IR blaster also makes an appearance on this 5.5-inch device. Talking about its camera, there will be a 13-megapixel rear shutter, followed by a 5-megapixel front camera and it’ll measure in these dimensions 152 x 76 x 8.55mm; it’s quite amazing to think that a 6,020 mAh battery can fit within an 8.55mm thick smartphone that weighs 215 grams. Those in India can pick it up for Rs. 17,999 (RM 1,137) on Flipkart in these colours; white, black and gold.

The   is their biggest yet with a gigantic 18.4″ screen and it runs on Android. In their latest ad, Samsung isn’t calling it a TV or a Tablet, but simply “entertainment reimagined”. Since both TV and tablets are generally media consumption devices, Samsung attempts to blur the line between the two, offering a larger screen experience in a somewhat “portable” form factor. Weighing at about 2.65kg, it is heavier than your average mobile device. With a handle at the back of the kickstand, Samsung wants it to be as easy to carry as a shopping bag. According to Samsung, the Galaxy View is designed to be used from an arm’s reach, hence they have created a new UI with larger icons and text for a more intuitive experience. Furthermore, the way people watch TV is much different now, with more opting to look for content when they want it, rather than to follow broadcast programs.  For gaming, the Galaxy View has an S Console game app, where you can project your mobile games onto a bigger screen. It turns your smart phone into a controller for a console gaming-like experience. While the hardware could potentially replace a TV, it is a pity that Samsung hasn’t included the essential TV ports such as HDMI. This could have opened up the Galaxy View as a portable TV for console gaming or to connect to other AV equipment.  In the US, it is currently priced at US$499 which is about RM2,110. It gets a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM and there’s a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of storage that’s expandable with microSD.

To make matters worse,   had only offered a vague explanation as to why the device was taken off the shelves late last week. This week, LG have finally decided to open up a little more and reveals that the device was pulled because of an issue with its display. When LG initially axed the Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, the company   that there was a problem with the smartwatch’s hardware and it affected “day-to-day functionality of the device”. Because of the “complicated nature of the issue” LG told Android Police that they would be cancelling the rollout of the device indefinitely. They added that future device availability would be decided at a later time as their top priority was quality assurance. Now, an LG representative told English daily The Telegraph that there was an issue with “a new advanced component” that had “never been used in an LG wearable device before”. Not wanting to point fingers or burn bridges with suppliers, LG simply said that after hours of stress testing, the “advanced component” failed to meet their quality standards and would have affected the smartwatch’s image quality. With that out in the open, critics can safely guess that the “advanced component” is the watch’s P-OLED display. The device was the first smartwatch to achieve a 480×480 pixel resolution, rating the device’s 1.3” screen at a stunning 490 ppi. For more information on the device, head on over  . OLED displays, though widely shipped in smartphones, is notorious for the amount of problems they come with such as image burn in and rotting pixels, something manufacturers have to work to mitigate. Since LG stated that the problem would only occur over the life of the device, Ars Technica suspects that it is due to significant image burn in or subpixel death. When pixels rot and die, the blue pixels are usually the first to go, resulting in a loss of brightness and inacurate colours, something we doubt any Watch Urbane 2 users would want. Besides its hyped screen, the LG’s follow up to the   was also set to be the first   device to have a built-in LTE modem. Being forced to drop such a high profile device after only six days due to an oversight in quality assurance must be incredibly painful for the electronics giant, something we doubt they will ever want to repeat. Large manufacturers often have large departments whose primary task is to ensure that their products meet the company’s quality standards, so it does seem a little odd that such a fundamental error was made by LG.

After images of the device leaked awhile back, official TENAA images have surfaced and it looks like the design holds true. The second-generation Galaxy A7 will closely resemble this year’s flagship Galaxy S6 with a metal band sandwiched between what looks like two planes of glass. Key internal specifications have also been revealed. The device, bearing the model number SM-A7100, will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.7GHz paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal memory. This is slightly different from our   which suggested that the device would be powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon 610 processor. The Galaxy A7 will also feature a 5.5-inch OLED display pushing 1920×1080 pixels, and will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box, which are in line with earlier leaks. Imaging appears to be identical to the leaked specifications as well with the Galaxy A7 sporting a 13-megapixel primary camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing one for selfies. On paper it appears that the second-gen Galaxy A7 isn’t that much of an upgrade to it’s predecessor as the only notable difference is the extra 1GB of RAM. With specs like these, it begs the question, why bother upgrading?"

It’s been a quick half a year for the company since being the first Internet TV service to pop up in the Southeast Asian market. Unique to the brand, they’re the only subscription based service to natively offer downloadable content – nope, even Netflix doesn’t do it. This isn’t that new though, since the feature has been living on your apps since the 8  of November for Android users and the 19  of November for iOS devices. There are some limitations though, you’re able to download 10 titles, movies or TV shows in any combination, and have them on your smartphone for 7 days; after which it’ll be automatically removed. Stream your content to bigger screens through iflix integration with Google’s Chromecast, enabling you to keep it on your phone but take it to another level onto TVs if needed. The application and service has now reached 3 countries – Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, with their reach promised to grow throughout other SEA countries in the near future. Amassing 850,000 users in just half a year, the company envisions that this new product feature will “address the demands and challenges faced by consumers in emerging market, including inconsistent infrastructure, expensive and limited mobile data allowances. The launch of Download and Watch Offline is a testament to our commitment to provide the best service and experience possible to our subscribers.” – to quote Mark Britt, Group CEO.

Fittingly, our dear landline and internet provider,   now has a   for the Star Wars Battlefront PS4 bundle only for their customers. That said, if you weren’t one of the lucky few that picked up your unit on Sony Malaysia’s online store, since units are now  , here’s another chance. Fans of the Battlefront series will finally have their hand at playing the reboot to the original from 2004. Rated an 8/10 from IGN, the game itself is considered to be a first-person/third-person shooter and you’ll be engulfed in the battle of the Rebel Alliance against the Imperial Fleet. Dart across the worlds of Endor, Hoth, Tatooine and Sullust with characters such as Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Leia Organa and Darth Vader. Then again, you could easily pick up the game by itself and go on playing on your regular PS4 but that wouldn’t be as fun. Adding some great visuals on the 500GB console unit itself, with Vader himself being illustrated onto the front of the unit and one special DUALSHOCK 4 coloured in black, red and white to match the character. Other than the regular cables, AC power head and a one-year warranty, Sony also throws in four Star Wards Classics Voucher Cards that’ll give you access to exclusive games from yesteryears: Oh and they also add a 12-month subscription for PlayStation Plus in the bundle as well. Looks like there will be a lot of gaming happening towards the end of the year, what more with the holiday season coming around; this could definitely make a great gift for someone who loves the Star Wars series and gaming in general. Do note that this pre-order is only open to new or existing UniFi Advance Plan customers and the pre-order system will only begin at 3 pm on the 1st of December. No pricing has been mentioned by TM but as a reference point, Sony Malaysia lists it at RM 1,849 (w/ GST).

Don’t get me wrong, I love my unnecessary gadgets. In fact I have an entire argument laid out about how I absolutely need a tablet/laptop hybrid even though I already have a laptop. desktop and phablet. That said, I just never saw the point of the Bluetooth speaker. I’ll admit, I’m no audiophile. Nor was I born in the time frame where “Say Anything…” was a thing. So the notion of carrying around an extra, rather heavy and rather expensive device just to play my music out loud – something I personally detest – seemed incredibly perplexing. Now that we’ve established my comic-book-esque origin story, we arrive at   (UE BOOM). Bought over by Logitech in 2008, Ultimate Ears have been making audio equipment since 1995. Their latest device, the UE BOOM, is an RM799 Bluetooth speaker the size of a can of ping pong balls, designed to be rugged as a rock and perfect for when you need to play your music out loud for everyone to hear.

Offering the same compact 7.9″ size, the new tablet gets an all metal body which is a huge leap over the plasticky predecessor. Compared to the previous version, the new Mi Pad 2 is 18% thinner at 6.95mm (Mi Pad: 8.5mm) and it is 11% lighter at 322g (Mi Pad: 360g). The Mi Pad 2 is also narrower and shorter as well, thanks to its reduced bezel design.  The front 7.9″ display is pretty much retained with a 2048×1536 resolution that pushes a pixel density of 326 ppi. This is the same resolution as the current  . Some of the new improvements include a Reading Mode which cuts down on harmful blue light and a button lock feature which deactivates the capacitive home, menu and back buttons when the tablet is held in landscape.  While the old Mi Pad runs on Nvidia’s Tegra K1 chipset, the Mi Pad 2 is Xiaomi’s first Intel-powered device with a 14nm 64-bit Atom X5-8500 processor with 2GB of RAM.  Storage wise it receives the same options of either 16GB or 64GB of storage. This time round, it appears that it lacks a microSD expansion slot, which isn’t good news for those wanting to store loads of TV shows on their tablet.  The cameras combination appears unchanged with a 8MP f/2.0 camera capable of shooting full HD videos at the rear while the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 shooter. The twin speaker grilles are still placed at the back, which could have been better placed at the front or at least on the sides. Powering the tablet is a smaller 6,190mAh battery that claims to push 100 hours of music playback or 12.5 hours of video streaming. It uses the new USB Type C connector to charge and it supports a typical 5V/2A fast charging standard. In terms of connectivity, it supports Bluetooth 4.1 and high speed 802.11ac WiFi. Like the predecessor, there’s no cellular 4G LTE version available.  Out of the box, the Mi Pad 2 runs on MIUI 7 OS that’s based on Android. The 16GB Mi Pad 2 goes for 999 CNY (about RM662) while the 64GB version is priced at 1,299 CNY (about RM861), which is pretty decently priced for the hardware and build quality it offers.  If you’re looking for something different, Xiaomi is also releasing a Windows 10 64GB edition as well for the same price of 1,299 CNY. It offers a full Windows experience, supporting your popular Microsoft office apps for greater productivity in a compact form factor. For more info, head over to the   product page."

As they often say, better late than never. This late arrival isn’t unprecedented since the same smartwatch had issues launching in China but that was mainly due to Android Wear compatibility and Google services restrictions in the country. Going for the rather traditional approach, the watch itself is a circular watch face that sports a sapphire crystal screen. Taking a second look at the device for those who aren’t too familiar with its specs; it carries a 1.4 inch AMOLED screen with a 400 x 400 resolution. While running the show underneath its stainless steel body is a Snapdragon 400 SoC mated to 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage. Syncing and connectivity will go through Bluetooth 4.1 and you’ll find the typical fitness centric sensors inside, allowing you to track your heart rate, steps and calories too. The Huawei Watch has a 42mm footprint and on the top right you’ll notice a 18mm lug to go along with it. Powering everything will be a 300 mAh battery and at the same time it’s compatible with Android and iOS devices that run at least 4.3 or iOS 8.2, respectively.

For Malaysia, the OnePlus X is officially priced at RM1,288 and it comes 16GB of storage. Oddly the spec-sheet listed on the page mentions 64GB of storage instead. On top of that, Lazada is giving an additional RM25 off if you use the oneplusx25 promo code. For those who can’t wait, the folks at DirectD had started   the same device a couple of weeks back for RM1,299. Boasting craftsmanship with premium materials, the OnePlus X is their compact offering with a 5″ display and it is available only in Onyx version. Spec-wise, it is quite similar with its first flagship killer, the OnePlus One. The AMOLED screen pushes a standard Full HD resolution and it runs on a 2.3GHz Quad-Core Snapdragon 801 processor mated to 3GB of RAM. Unlike the One, the OnePlus X has a dual-SIM slot supporting 4G LTE, with the 2nd slot doubling up as a microSD expansion.  The rear camera is a 13MP f/2.2 shooter while selfies are taken with its front 8MP camera. On-board there’s a non-removable 2,525mAh capacity battery and the side also features a 3-step alert slider that was first introduced on the OnePlus 2. For charging and data transfer, it settles for a more traditional microUSB port. Out of the box, it runs on OxygenOS that’s based on Android 5.1.1.

Especially when consumers in China are so spoiled for choice when it comes to mobile electronics.   lead the pack during the momentous day, raking in a cool RM 856 million but was that enough reason for them to release the   so early? Well they did it anyway, and for the first time it features an all-metal design, biometric security and a huge battery. 
 The Chinese manufacturer places high hopes on their most “premium” (if that word is fair) Redmi Note to date. Let’s talk about how it has changed, taking over the Redmi Note 2 in the most casual way possible; the biggest change would be the utilisation of a smooth metal finish – made by sandblasting the metallic layer. Surrounding the smartphone with the element and curving at the edges. Apparently, these curves will make the device more ergonomic when held, it’ll also just weigh 164grams, 4g heavier than the smartphone it replaces. Even with its massive 4000 mAh battery, the Redmi Note 3 will only be 8.65mm thick. They’ve managed to do this by using a 690Wh/L high density battery, that saves space underneath frame. Something really different this time around, the Redmi Note 3 will include a rear fingerprint sensor – a feature that has never been seen on older Xiaomi devices. They promise that you’ll be able to get into your device in less than 0.3seconds with the touch of your fingerprint. As far as recognition goes, the Redmi Note 3 will store up to 5 fingerprints, if you’d want to give other prying individuals the ability to unlock your pocket companion. It’ll also give you access to make secure payments through the aforementioned sensor. Otherwise it says relatively the same – which wasn’t awful to begin with. Here’s a recap on those specs: A MediaTek Helio X10 processor underneath the 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen. It’ll have 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal memory, while there will be a 13-megapixel shutter on the rear. Moving your way up front, you’ll be greeted by a 5-megaxpiel sensor. A power-packed package with near flagship like specs, since they’ve added a 3GB RAM and 32GB of internal memory option. Oh and did we mention; it’ll sell from RMB 899 (RM 596) and be available in 3 colours – Silver, Dark Grey and Gold. The higher end 3GB RAM + 32GB ROM will go for RMB 1,099 ( RM 728) Going full mental (oops metal), Xiaomi has a lot going for it with its new smartphone and we expected the device to sell for at least RM 800 in Malaysia, but we’ll only know for sure when/if it arrives here. Do let us know your thoughts on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 in the comments below."

However, in terms of raw air cleaning power, the new model appears to fall short of the previous version, but not by a lot. Probably due to its size, the second-gen purifier outputs clean air in two modes, measuring a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) of 330 m3/h of clean air in standard mode and 388 m3/h of clean air in active mode, both of which are lower than the original Mi Air Purifier’s 406 m3/h. Cleaning range is also lower at up to 46.6 m2 of cleaning range, compared to the first-gen’s 48 m2 of effective coverage. It can also be attributed to the device’s single-motor, dual-fan setup versus its predecessor’s dual-motor, 4-air-duct engine. Despite that though, it boasts the ability to remove 99.7% of PM2.5 particles in just one hour, thanks to its triple filter setup. This isn’t to say that this new kid on the block is worse than its predecessor, because in every other aspect the sequel is an improvement. First off it is much smaller and lighter, measuring 240x240x520 mm versus the old air purifier’s 260x260x735 mm. It is also 58% more energy efficient and 11% quieter, weighing in at only 30db in Night mode. With the price of the Mi Air Purifier 2 set at RMB699 (around RM463), it is also much cheaper than the RMB899 (around RM596) Mi Air Purifer. Is the reduction in clean air output and coverage a trade-off you’re willing to make for a lighter, smaller, cheaper, quieter and more energy efficient air purifier? I know we are."

Word had gotten out of TENAA that a smartphone had passed its certification; after which details of the   were spotted on Geekbench. Then on it got a whole lot for confusing, as   of the event went out and Xiaomi’s President   of the two devices. We’re going to try and make it easier for everyone to understand, at the same time giving out two cents on the whole situation. Metal isn’t one of the materials you’d usually find on a Xiaomi product, except for their higher-end range flagships – though the Mi Note and Mi 4 only explore using the element in minimal amounts, seen around the edges. The brand however, hasn’t started even considering finger print sensors on their flagships, hence the peculiarity of placing the aforementioned feature on the Redmi Note 2 Pro. It’ll be a totally new take, for the Redmi name if they decide to pursue the two features. Otherwise, it’ll have the same internals as its predecessor underneath. Moving to the other device that’s slated to launch, the Mi Pad 2; a device that didn’t confuse us as much as the former. Details on Geekbench made this short and sweet, stating what processor it’ll carry; an Intel Atom processor clocked to 2.24GHz and other accompanying specs. Xiaomi’s President didn’t stop there either, shortly after a few days, he decided to release photos of the smartphone and tablet. Leading us to finally cave in and actually believe that the company will release a follow up to the Redmi Note 2 before the same fiscal quarter comes to a close. Since then, more images go to contradict the existence of the Redmi Note 2 Pro, mentioning that it’ll instead be dubbed the Redmi Note 3. So far we know that it’ll be thin, light, have a fingerprint sensor and metal body. It isn’t farfetched to assume that Xiaomi wants to appeal to the higher-end market but adding two features on a non-flagship could either be a weird strategy or an opening of doors to more premium products in the future from the Chinese tech giant; yes, the Mi 5 too. Interestingly, new (rumoured) details have highlighted that the Redmi Note 3 will have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It’ll also supposedly be available with a 4000 mAh battery, making a huge jump from the existing device that only has a 3060 mAh battery. Maybe this long-shot might work for Xiaomi but we’re sure Redmi Note 2 customers won’t be too happy with this new information. We’ll wait for tomorrow to see what actually happens, who knows they might pull a “by the way” move and surprise everyone with more than two devices."

To no surprise, we’re expecting the     line to face the same fortunate (for us) fate. Addressing the potential processors inside the device before, today, new reports are alleging that Samsung might re-equip their flagships with one feature that when left out, have scorned their existing customer base; more so when Malaysia and other regions only received the 32GB for purchase option – yes, we mean reinstating a microSD slot on the smartphone(s) A plethora of options open up with 2016 on the horizon, with new processors and new camera technology, the possibilities are endless. The year will mark the latest generation of mobile processors as it’ll bring about launches of the Exynos 8890, Kirin 950, and the Qualcomm 820 – no matter how unnecessary these high-end chipsets might be, the thirst for more power and futureproofing devices aren’t slowing down one bit. It’s likely that the Galaxy S7 series will see two SoC options, one Exynos and one Qualcomm; both models listed above, though they might be region specific. Other specs purported by rumours would be the latest reversible USB Type-C port and a display that reacts differently when more pressure is applied. If that sounds familiar, it’ll be some sort of 3D Touch/Pressure Sensitive display you’ve seen on the current-gen iPhones and Huawei devices. The announcement of BRITECELL, Samsung’s new camera technology then brings better potential for low-light photography. Enhancing photos and light sensitivity in badly lit conditions and boasts 1.0µm. You can read more about that  . It’s been said that the Galaxy S7 edge will not be dual edged on the sides but instead have the same tapering glass on the top and bottom. Given the circumstances, this would be possible, since the manufacturer did patent a top-to-bottom curved display of late. Leaving leaks and rumours as they are, it’ll be interesting to see how redesigned the next flagship devices from Samsung will look like; since we can already expect them to go all the way when it comes to internal components. Would you spare Samsung another look, if they toyed with the idea of putting a microSD card back inside? Was that one of the reasons that made you leave the Galaxy series? Let us know your thoughts and reactions in the comments below."
Arif Lee,Official teaser by Xiaomi’s President confirms the existence of the Redmi Note 2 Pro and the Mi Pad 2,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/20/official-teaser-by-xiaomis-ceo-confirms-the-existence-of-the-redmi-note-2-pro-and-the-mi-pad-2/,"Announcement,ceo,launch,leak,Lin Bin,Mi Pad 2,MIUI 7,official,Pro,Redmi Note 2,Redmi Note 2 Pro,rumour,tenaa,Xiaomi,Xiaomi announcement,Xiaomi Mi Pad 2,Xiaomi Redmi Note 2,xiaomi redmi note 2 pro","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Xiaomi",2015-11-20,"Earlier on, we discussed the potential of   releasing   that we thought couldn’t be the higher-end version of the Redmi Note 2. Highlighted in our older articles, it didn’t seem to make sense to deploy something totally new to the brand, on a smartphone that could easily be mistaken to be a mid-range device – guess we were wrong, since Lin Bin, the President of the Chinese manufacturer teased two of their upcoming releases, that include the   and the   on his Weibo social media account. Making rounds earlier on, being shown passing   process, the Redmi Note 2 Pro is a really an odd device. We say so because it seems to include a finger-print sensor and metal-backed built – never seen before on any Xiaomi device. Plastering the aforementioned circular sensor on the back, underneath the LED module for the rear camera, they seem to have adopted the stylings of other Chinese smartphone makers. Since it’s the Pro version of the Redmi Note 2, it won’t have any other distinctive qualities, aside from mentioned above. Having said, it’ll carry a 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) resolution screen and underneath its glass panel you’ll likely find an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 clocked to 2GHz. Chances are you’ll find 2GB of RAM inside but rumours have discussed the possibilities of a 3GB RAM option as well; while it’ll have 16GB of native memory on board too. As far as camera optics goes, the same 13-megapixel rear shooter and 5-megapixel front sensor combo will apparently return. Powering the Redmi Note 2 Pro will be a 3060 mAh battery and it’ll run a backdated version of Android, likely 5.0.2 under its   skin. The bigger device revealed by Lin Bin was the Mi Pad 2 and by the looks of it, it’ll be really thin and have an uncanny resemblance to Apple’s iPads. Without giving away too much, the tablet looks to be fashioned entirely out of metal and feature a very sleek silhouette. It’s thought to carry a quad-core Intel chipset clocked to 2.24GHz. Interestingly, you won’t have to wait much longer since these two devices are slated to make an appearance during a Xiaomi event in China on the 24  of November. Still rolling on the excitement of getting our hands on the Redmi Note 2 domestically, we’re hoping that the smartphone maker will release the much-anticipated Mi 5 as well."
Arif Lee,Maxis talks about what makes its 4G network great,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/19/maxis-talks-about-what-makes-its-4g-network-great/,,,2015-11-19,"Population coverage for 4G LTE has been a   of recent times; at least for two telcos –   and  . This overdrawn rally between the two has managed to do one thing, get both their customers rattled up. We’re seeing more negative comments from our readers of late, regarding their own experiences on the two networks. When push comes to shove, what we need are clear outlines on how each cellular provider measures themselves, and this is essentially what Maxis talked about earlier today. The parameters set by our telcos determine if they’ve set the bar(s) (figuratively) for their network, high enough to be considered acceptable by consumers. Quoting Maxis reps, 4G LTE is currently growing at an alarming rate and to keep up with that upward trend is a tough task but the green telco believes that the standards it has set is more than adequate enough to live up to their claims. Mentioning briefly that their 4G LTE population coverage is at 62%, placed in 144 locations including state capitals and secondary towns. If you kept track of the current developments, that betters Digi’s numbers by 2%; though there have different levels of signal strength, one being more stringent in their definitions of measurement. Backed by a desire to provide the most consistent experience across 2G, 3G, 4G and beyond, they’ve established standards that maintain their reputation and position as the best telco to provide a high performing internet experience.

Rory Lee,"From soft drinks to smartphones, the Pepsi Phone P1 is now official",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/20/from-soft-drinks-to-smartphones-the-pepsi-phone-p1-is-now-official/,"Android,Pepsi,Pepsi P1,Pepsi Phone P1,Pepsi smartphone,Phone P1,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-20,"It’s official. Soft drink mega-corporation Pepsi has taken its first step into the mobile industry by launching its own crowdfunding campaign on JD Finance to  , the Pepsi Phone P1. Back in October,   that the soft-drink manufacturer would be releasing their own line of mobile accessories and even their own smartphone based in China. While preliminary specs were leaked, the information train stopped there and interest in the device screeched to a halt. Now that the world’s 29th most valuable brand has pulled back the covers of its pet project, we finally get to see some cold, hard specs. The device will come sporting a 5.5” 1080p display housed under 2.5D glass, with an octa-core 1.7GHz MediaTek MT6792 processor and 2GB of RAM at its heart. It only has 16GB of internal storage but that’s expandable via a hybrid dual-SIM tray up to 64GB. Out of the box, the device is said to run on Android 5.1 Lollipop with dido OS 6.1 plastered on top. For imaging, the device runs a 13-megapixel (f/2.0, 1/3.06 CMOS sensor) back snapper and 5-megapixel front camera combo. Interestingly, the Phone P1 also mounts a fingerprint scanner on the back of the device, right below the camera. To bring all of these parts to life, the phone will draw power from a 3,000 mAh battery. Since it’s a crowdfunding project, the device will be available through several layers of perks and support. The early bird option allowed interested parties to get the phone for CNY499 (around RM335), but that was only limited to the first 1,000 supporters. You can still opt for the limited CNY699 (around RM468) option which is still a good deal. Backers can also opt to get the phone at its full price of CNY1,299 (around RM870) instead. With only two weeks remaining, the Pepsi Phone P1 is still a long, long way from being funded so there is a chance that this whole thing could just fizzle out. If it does succeed though, it would be interesting to see if Pepsi’s nemesis Coca-Cola would take a gander at a mobile device. Specs wise, the phone looks like a fairly ordinary midrange device, but with its metal body we suspect that people will buy this purely as a novelty item rather than to use as a daily driver. All we’d like to see is for the device come in a phone sized Pepsi can instead of a boring old smartphone box."
Rory Lee,Hands-on with the Lenovo Vibe P1 and Vibe P1m,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/21/hands-on-with-the-lenovo-vibe-p1-and-vibe-p1m/,"5000 mAh battery,Android,big battery phone,lenovo launch malaysia,Lenovo Malaysia,Lenovo Vibe P1,Lenovo Vibe P1 Malaysia,Lenovo Vibe P1m,Lenovo Vibe P1m Malaysia,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-21,"Launched recently, the   and   are designed to last as long as you can with its enormous battery capacities of 5,000 mAh and 4,000 mAh respectively. These smartphones from   can also, in a pinch, double as powerbanks and charge your other devices via USB OTG (On-The-Go). As you can tell by the battery capacities, the Vibe P1 is designed to be the flag bearer of the “Power Player” line, while the Vibe P1m comes in as the runner-up. On paper that is very much the case as the Vibe P1 sports a 5.5″ full-HD IPS display and a brushed aluminium frame. The device’s unibody construction gives it a premium feel with a gentle curve at the back allowing the phone to fit nicely in the hand. In front you will find the front camera at the top and two capacitive buttons at the bottom, flanking the rectangular physical home button. Underneath the clicky, well-built button lies the Vibe P1’s fingerprint scanner which is a first for Lenovo. Around the back, the smartphone looks a lot like the flagships from   series. The main camera can be found at the top of the phone with the dual-LED flash right below it. The power button and volume keys are placed on the right side of the phone while the Vibe P1’s dedicated power saver toggle is located on the left. To differentiate the buttons, the power saver toggle has rough texture versus the smooth power and volume buttons. Either way, all the keys have a satisfying click without much wobble. The speaker grille and micro-USB port is located at the bottom opposite the phone’s headphone jack at the top. The top comes off revealing a tray that holds two nano-SIM cards and a microSD slot. As a whole, the device feels good in the hand. Even with that massive battery, the weight isn’t unbearable although it is rather thick and that adds to the bulk. The brushed aluminium helps the phone stay in the hand while staving off fingerprints. Much of the Vibe P1’s physical features are identical on its little brother, with the exception of the micro-USB port being on the top and the absence of a physical home button and fingerprint scanner on the Vibe P1m. Around the back, the primary camera is in the same place as the Vibe P1 but there is a brushed metal finish around the lens LED flash. The front is occupied by the Vibe P1m’s 5-inch 720p display, three capacitive buttons and the 5-megapixel camera at the top. The device is coated with a splash-proof nano coating. While the P1m does not have a brushed aluminium back, the textured removable rear cover feels very nice and sturdy, giving the phone even more grip. The smaller size also fits better in the hand, making up for its rather thick profile. Within the Vibe P1 beats the heart of an octa-core Snapdragon 615 clocked at 1.5GHz, 2GB of RAM and, 32GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD). On the other hand, the lower end Vibe P1m is powered by a 1.0GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735P processor and 2GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 16GB but it is also expandable via microSD up to 32GB. Performance is good as both devices run smoothly on Android 5.1 Lollipop with almost no stuttering or noticeable lag when launching, exiting or switching between applications. It looks like Lenovo spent some time making sure that the software and hardware for both devices were well optimised. Then again, the Vibe P1m’s smooth performance can also be credited to the fact that it has less pixels to push on that smaller 720p display. Primary imaging on the Vibe P1 is taken care of by its 13-megapixel PDAF rear shooter while selfies can be delegated to the 5-megapixel fixed focus front camera. Our limited time with the Vibe P1’s camera reveals that it is snappy to launch and take pictures, but the venue’s poor lighting made it difficult to give a solid verdict on the camera’s performance. The same can also be said for the Vibe P1m’s 8-megapixel rear/5-megapixel front camera combo. Sitting under the back plate, powering all those hardware bits, lies the devices’ defining feature: their massive batteries. The Vibe P1 sports a 5,000 mAh battery that Lenovo claims gives the device 30 days of standby time and 45 hours of talk time. The phone also comes with Quick Charge 2.0 for when it eventually runs out of juice. Lenovo said that it would take 2 hours to charge up the P1 from empty using the device’s bundled charger. The Vibe P1m features a smaller, but still massive by conventional standards, 4,000 mAh battery. Besides the massive batteries, Lenovo took power saving to the next level with their included power saver toggle, available on both devices. With the power saver toggle flicked on, the phone enters power saver mode where the usual home screen is replaced by a simple black and white interface, showing you the clock, the battery level, a choice of six apps and how much time you have left before the phone runs out of juice. Very Jack Bauer. The six apps can be set by the user but by default three of the app slots are taken up by phone, contacts, and messaging. The Lenovo Vibe P1 which retails for RM1,199, will come in Platinum and Graphite Grey colour options. This device will be available in authorised retail stores and   starting 19 November. On the other hand, the Vibe P1m, costing RM649, will   from 19 November onwards, only hitting the shelves at authorised local retail outlets in December. As a bonus though, if you do choose to purchase the Vibe P1m from Lazada, they’re currently offering an RM50 discount and are throwing in a Lenovo Limited Edition Jersey and an 8GB SanDisk microSD card for free."

Now, it seems that  ’s premium Nexus phone has encountered a new problem: spotty voice quality. Several threads on the Google Product Forum and XDA-Developers have spawned with users complaining that people on the other end of their phone conversations couldn’t hear them very well. The problem appears to extend to the speakerphone as well. Based on unofficial experimentation by Nexus 6P users, it appears to be a problem with the phone’s noise cancellation setup. Some users say that covering the rear microphone solves this issue while others discovered that this actually causes the problem. For those who are unaware, most new smartphones use multiple microphones to supplement the main microphone to filter out surrounding noise, like wind, to improve the vocal clarity of phone calls. The root of the problem does seem to be related to this setup on the Nexus 6P as one of the users who posted on the Google forum indicated that a root-level build.prop modification solved the issue for him. On the plus side, Google representatives have responded to the posts on the official forum, letting users know that they are looking into it though as of this moment there is no official statement on the cause of these problems. Let’s hope that Google can fix this issue with a software update and not have to resort to recalling users’ shiny new Nexus 6P devices."

Rory Lee,Samsung’s latest W2016 smartphone is a clamshell with flagship specs,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/22/samsungs-latest-w2016-smartphone-is-a-clamshell-with-flagship-specs/,"AMOLED,Android,clamshell,Flip phone,Samsung,samsung clamshell,samsung flip phone,Samsung Galaxy Golden,Samsung Galaxy Golden 2,Samsung Galaxy Golden 3,Samsung Galaxy S6,Samsung W2016,smart phone,smartphone,W2016","Android,Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-11-22,"Mistaken as the  , Korean electronics giant   have quietly revealed their latest handset, the W2016. If you’re familiar with Samsung’s line of clamshell smartphones running Android, then it should come as no surprise that many thought this latest flip phone was going to be the successor to the Galaxy Golden 2. This new flip phone is no underpowered feature phone though. Sporting two 3.9” AMOLED displays pushing 1280×768 pixels, an   chip, 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, this flip phone is essentially a   in a forgotten form factor. The primary camera is no slouch either as it likely the same high end 16-megapixel rear snapper as that in Samsung’s early 2015 flagship, with a 5-megapixel front camera to boot. Samsung’s W2016 will run   5.1.1 Lollipop with TouchWiz out of the box and the Korean manufacturer has also included modern elements like fast wired and wireless charging. Powering the device is a 2,000 mAh battery, which should be more than enough for the relatively small 3.9” screens to stay lit for a respectable amount of time. To many, the clamshell form factor is a thing of the past and it seems weird that Samsung would put so much into reviving it. But to some niche markets in Asia and nostalgic fans of this once glorious design, this is a welcomed move and we can see why. Aesthetically, the W2016 looks exquisite. The body is a sculpted aluminium frame that kind of emulates the Galaxy S6’s design, with a curved metal back and metallic accents. The screen sits flush into the front panel and the gentle slope towards the bottom of the phone gives it a much sleeker look. It looks like the kind of sophisticated device meant for the 0.01%, and not some playboy’s new gadget. Availability of the device at this point seems to be limited to China, without any news on whether or not it will make it to the rest of the world. While we do not have information on the pricing of the device, we wouldn’t be too surprised if it will eventually be sold elsewhere. On paper, the W2016 looks like a great way to bring the clamshell into today’s standards. For those of us who have used flip phones in the past, there is no doubt that we will remember this form factor fondly. Let’s face it, there aren’t many more satisfying ways to end a conversation than with the solid click of a clamshell snapping shut."

No information on the iPhone 6c’s build was found, but if it will continue the trend set by the iPhone 5c, then the body will likely be made out of plastic with an array of colourful options. Earlier, alleged photos of the iPhone 5c were leaked, showing a plastic build and an oval camera LED flash that’s likely a dual-tone colour unit. It wouldn’t be too surprising if Apple decides to continue the ‘c’ badge as sales for the iPhone 5c were actually higher than expected. In Malaysia though, we’re not so sure. How many iPhone 5cs have you seen in Malaysia? Do let us know down below."

About a week ago, a trademark application from Samsung was spotted for BRITECELL, which then sparked another set of rumours about the Galaxy S7’s camera. Well, Samsung has finally revealed the BRITECELL camera technology, though they did not provide any confirmation on whether or not it would be the one in the Galaxy S7. Revealed by Samsung LSI marketing head Kyushik Hong, BRITECELL promises enhanced light sensitivity in low-light conditions with less colour artifact. BRITECELL was not the rumoured Galaxy S7 1/2-inch sensor with large pixels though as it actually has smaller one micron pixels. Samsung says that these smaller pixels will help reduce the module height by 17% while maintaining low-light sensitivity at 1.12µm. The sensor also utilises Samsung’s Smart WDR technology which will help provide a more detailed image by using multi-exposure for better spatial resolution and Phase Detection Auto Focus (PDAF) for faster, more accurate photos. Although the electronics giant did not confirm whether this BRITECELL technology would be used in their smartphones, if they do, the Galaxy S7 could very well be the first one to receive it. With the BRITECELL’s focus on improving low-light performance, the next-generation Samsung phones could be significantly better than its predecessors.

The Mate 8 apparently carries the   SoC, which could pose a threat to Samsung and Qualcomm’s top performing chips. Embracing the need for higher processing needs, the 950 Kirin processor will boast some highly clocked ARM Cortex cores; the four A72’s will run at 2.3GHz, while the more efficient A53 cores are listed at 1.8GHz. This is based on the big.LITTLE system, that allows an optimised Octa-Core set up, balancing between raw power and power consumption. Along with the aforementioned CPU, it’ll have a Mali-T880MP4 GPU to help out the graphics department. Rumours state that we should expect two models of the smartphone, taking note of two screen resolutions – 1920 x 1080 (FHD) and 2560 x 1440 (QHD) on the same 6-inch screen. Other sources speculate there will be differing internals on differing models. As such, one will supposedly offer 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage – you’d be expected to purchase this device for roughly US$ 517 (RM 2,266). The other model that touts 4GB of RAM and a massive 128GB of internal memory will go for US$ 611 (RM 2,678). Encased under the metal body, there’s a 4,100 mAh battery and it’s bound to have Android 6.0 underneath Huawei’s EMUI 4.0 skin. The invitations have already been detailed here, stating that it’ll be officially announced on the 26  of November. Looks like there’s gonna be a whole lot more metal from Huawei from now on."

Doubling up on functionality as a regular watch and now enabling you to use it as a clock will be much appreciated for those who purchased the smartwatch that starts from SG$ 518 (RM 1,590). Resembling a hockey puck, just a little flatter and tapered at the edges, techcrunch assumes that the dock is fashioned out of plastic, while the usual circular magnetic unit sits inside. Charging can be done in two orientations, the Nightstand mode, which allows the wearable to sit upright and the flat mode, setting your   onto the coaster. While other after-market options still utilise the charging puck that comes with Apple Watch, the Magnetic Charging Dock has its very own puck built-in. So at least for the price, the dock, only needs a lightning cable plugged into the back to power up. Apple hasn’t trailed away from their own proprietary cables and ports, but   has jumped on the same bandwagon, so the blame should be equally shared. Ridding consumers the convenience of universal plugs and ports, it’ll be harder to find a supported cable while at home or work (other than the one you already have). If you have an Apple Watch, or are thinking of purchasing one, you’ll have to get it in Singapore, the nearest option for Malaysians. Permitted that you’re willing to make the trip, you can purchase it  . While the magnetic dock that goes for SG$ 118 (RM 360), can also be   on the neighbouring country’s online Apple store."

These devices are designed for the busy user who needs a phone that won’t run out of juice before they do. The Vibe P1 is the higher end of the duo and will come with a 5.5-inch full-HD IPS display, powered by a 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor and 2GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 32GB but that’s expandable up to 128GB with a microSD card. The phone also has dual-SIM capabilities and supports 4G LTE. Beneath the Vibe P1’s aluminium body lies its party piece, the enormous 5,000 mAh battery with quick charge support. Security is also beefed up with a fingerprint scanner located underneath the physical home button. Camera wise, the Vibe P1 sports a 13-megapixel rear shooter with PDAF and a dual-LED flash alongside a 5-megapixel fixed focus front camera that is enhanced with a host of beauty features. On the other hand, the lower end Vibe P1m will instead be packaged with a 5-inch 720p HD display with a 1.0GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735P processor, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage running under the hood. The P1m also supports expandable memory in the form of a microSD card up to 32GB. As a little cherry on top, the Vibe P1m will also get a splash-proof nano coating that will protect itself from accidental spills. In the optics department, the Vibe P1m gets a watered down 8-megapixel back + 5-megapixel front camera combo. Like its bigger brother, the Vibe P1m will also support dual-SIM and 4G LTE connectivity. Compared to the massive 5,000 mAh battery in the Vibe P1, this lower end device will ‘only’ have a 4,000 mAh battery, but since it is bundled with a lower 720p display, the smartphone should have no problems lasting you a day. When you do eventually need to charge it, you can have it up and running again in a jiffy with the phone’s Quick Charge 2.0 support. Lenovo states that a full charge for the Vibe P1 from empty would take 2 hours on its own charger. Both devices will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Both smartphones also have the ability to charge other USB powered devices through a USB OTG (On-The-Go) cable. The Vibe devices also have a dedicated power saver switch to extend its battery life should it go low. When toggled on however, the phone brings up a new home screen where you can assign six apps to use during power saver mode. The Vibe P1 will set you back RM1,199 and comes in Platinum and Graphite Grey options, whereas the Vibe P1m will retail for RM649 and have Pearl White and Onyx Black as colour options. If you want to get your hands on these devices, the Vibe P1 will be available in authorised retail stores and   starting 19 November. The Vibe P1m, on the other hand, will be available exclusively via   from 19 November onwards and will only hit the shelves of authorised local retailers in December. Lazada is offering an RM50 discount and two free gifts with every purchase of the Vibe P1m."

The phone measures 144.6 x 69.7 x 9.6mm and weighs a touch more than the original One M9 at 158g versus the base model’s 157g.

The affected users complained that the iPad Pro refuses to boot up after leaving them to charge. After resolving the issue with the force reset method, the battery levels were listed at 100%. More comments pour in sharing the same sentiments but at least Apple is aware of the issue, or at least their Support Communities site is. Their response isn’t much help though, as they suggest to perform a simple factory reset, wiping your device on iTunes. While the other was to try the aforementioned force reset by holding the sleep/wake and home buttons in tandem, till you see the device force resetting. This issue isn’t distinctive to the iPad Pro, as other users are reporting this same problem with other iDevices – iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Could this be a batch issue? Well we hope it can be mediated just by a software update, with iOS 9 being relatively new with on going fixes being released every now and then.

Since Apple hasn’t issued an official statement on the matter, we’re just gonna consider these reports to be rare cases.

C’mon, the movies have told us at least that much. True enough,   came up with their “revolutionary”   technology that they claimed required countless hours of research to produce, but ended up being not much more than a gimmick, at least for now with the low amount of apps that actually make use of it. Well, if you want something more revolutionary, the boffins at Qeexo might just have what you need. Carnegie Mellon spin-off Qeexo have come up with a new algorithm that allows smartphones to recognise the angular position of a finger, and are hoping to change the way we interact with our devices. Dubbed the FingerAngle, this algorithm attempts to improve movements and interactions with a touch screen – like pinching or rotating – which require an extra finger to carry out properly. While on most modern smartphones, requiring an extra finger may not seem like that much of an inconvenience as screen real estate is ample. But when you need to perform those same actions on smaller screened devices like wearables, it becomes a little more tricky. FingerAngle though, changes this as it allows those devices to determine if you are rotating your finger, if your finger is tilted upwards, downwards or even swiveled side to side. This software estimates a finger’s 3D angle relative to a screen’s surface by measuring the finger’s pitch and yaw. This then opens up a whole new avenue of possibility for interacting with your device beyond just making it easier for wearables. One prominent possibility is in mobile gaming controls, where currently we have to use on-screen controls or rely on a device’s accelerometer. With FingerAngle, the control possibilities have now completely opened up. FingerAngle’s promotional video clearly shows that there are some kinks to work out, the latency for example, but as this isn’t the final product yet, things are certainly looking good. Of course, this technology is still new and there is no definite timeline to when this software will go live. But as this is purely software, who knows, a manufacturer might pick it up and it could come sooner than you think."

In the face of this security breach, many tech organisations used their own means to help out by offering their services. The people behind AirBnB, Facebook, Google, Skype, Twitter all jumped into disaster relief mode. Can they along with other organisations continue in the light of similar tragic events around the world? We hope they do. Stemming from Twitter’s Porte Ouverte hashtag, that loosely translates to “Open Door”, Parisians used it to offer a temporary safe house, while those in public spaces could also look for those places and stay up to date on the happenings around the city. Facebook launched their Safety Check function, allowing those in the city a way to notify their loved ones that they were safe, albeit not doing so for other recent disasters that happened in other parts of the world. Users accused the social media site of being desensitised to the daily onslaught in the Middle East (e.g. Ankara and Beirut bombings); as such, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded by saying Facebook will enable this feature across the globe for future. This pivot in the industry could see more tech companies come to the aid of those affected, as their reach is truly global, and are limited only to the gadgets people carry around. Providing shelter, updates on loved ones and means of communication all for the human kind was a kind gesture that should be replicated given the circumstances. Consequently, the more connected the world becomes, the higher likeliness it will bring about an impending threat of terror organisations that camouflage themselves in the same social media networks as regular citizens – as Belgian minister Jan Jambon highlighted; ISIS agents have been driven to utilise the   network to communicate. Following the tragedy, how will nations react? Technology will be an actor regardless of what they do – meaning that states could possibly adopt new bills and acts that cover surveillance of its citizens. We at SoyaCincau offer our condolences to whoever lost their loved ones during this act of mindless violence and our hearts go out to anyone affected by this tragedy."

To add to their woes, their   cables are now coming under fire for not being spec compliant. Who, you might ask, is attacking OnePlus? Well, some call him the Caped Cable Crusader, others call him the USB Vigilante, but his almost 7,000 followers on Google+ should know him better as Benson Leung. Google employee by day, Amazon cable critic by night, Benson cautioned users who purchased the OnePlus USB Type-C cable against using it with their Chromebook Pixel or the new   devices. This was because Benson found that OnePlus’ cable used a 3A identifier resistor instead of the “Default USB Power” resistor, and as a result could cause damage to those devices. He also found that OnePlus’ USB Type-C adapter was also using the wrong identifier resistor, raising concern regarding the actual quality of OnePlus’ accessories. Benson wasn’t deliberately picking on OnePlus though as he had already launched a campaign to test USB Type-C cables off Amazon to see if they met the minimum standards or if they were merely rip-offs. His process consisted of ordering USB Type-C cables from various manufacturers on the site and then testing them, subsequently   on their respective product pages on Amazon. While some did not follow the Release 1.1 USB Type-C specifications, the more common problem it seemed was that many of the cables were using incorrect resistors. While many of the problematic cables were from third party manufacturers, OnePlus’ failure was certainly not expected since their motto was to “Never Settle”. Perhaps they were trying to create cables that only rewarded the faithful. In any case, OnePlus owners don’t have to worry as long as they don’t stick their cables into a device that doesn’t bear the OnePlus logo."

Though their definition of what 4G LTE speeds are, could baffle many. Beginning the discussion of the who’s the widest 4G LTE provider in October, they had   listed the 4G LTE coverage to be 50%; but is a 10% jump a realistic in such a short span? (we’re asking the same question) Anyway, by Digi’s valuation, their 4G LTE network will deliver more than 5Mbps 80% of the time – petty by industry  . They’ve also ramped up the number of network sites in Malaysia, adding 52 additional cell towers in the process. Furthermore, the telco provider mentions that of their 2 specified signal spectrums – 1,800Mhz and 2,600Mhz, there is now a 30% overlap. Simply going to say that a highly dense area won’t suffer as these dual-band offerings will come into play. Furthering the conversation, the company has announced LTE-Advanced, leveling at more than 10Mbps 80% of the time; they’ve managed to hit a 22% population coverage so far with this new technology. Again these speeds don’t meet up to standards of the world, as that speed should be easily achievable on a 3G network. Remember that by  , 4G LTE (alone) is supposed to reach 100Mbps for downloads, while on the move. Digi and other local telcos have a lot to do before being able to talk about 4G LTE as a whole, if they want to be taken seriously. Using their time wisely, Digi has added that they’ve begun plans to roll-out VoWiFi in 2016, adding on to their earlier announcement about beginning VoLTE next year, as well. Tying it all together, the telco has begun a campaign on Twitter for their users to voice where they want new 4G LTE towers; once it wraps up within a month, the top 10 locations will get a cell tower put up – nope, they aren’t kidding. It’s sad to see the yellow coloured network provider list such low levels for 4G LTE (same goes for their supposed LTE-A). Taking a look at Maxis, who promise that their 4G LTE speeds exceed 15Mbps, at all hours, both indoor and outdoor. It isn’t even a competition,when the latter doesn’t maintain this either but they can manage 5Mbps easily. Of course, the tell of the tale today is about coverage but how we see it is a company just plucking numbers from the air, actions that only earn them bragging rights – without third party verification."

Moments of joy, sadness, heartbreak and the new experiences that capture the intricacies of what makes life worth living. Who could forget their first visit to a foreign place, the joy of that breathtaking sunset after a hard day’s climb or that first bite into the best burger you’ve ever had? The thing about moments though, is that they are like any other memory, they slip through the fragile grasp of our minds to the powerful tug of time. Moments end up hazy, becoming distant, unable to evoke the same emotions we felt on that day and that’s kind of a bummer because when we’re old and grey, memories of those moments are kind of all we have. Samsung plans to change that though, with the all new  , sporting its amazing 16-megapixel rear shooter, voted best camera by our readers, and the all new S Pen. Capturing moments in real life can be challenging as they are fleeting, often disappearing as quickly as they come. Couple that with lighting that is uncertain at best and you will be in for a hard time making sure that the image will properly reflect what you are seeing. This though, is where the Galaxy Note5’s fast f/1.9 lens comes in. The wide aperture allows a lot of light into the sensor, making sure that your stills stay well exposed even in the dark confines of KL Live. Combine that with Samsung’s auto real-time HDR and you are almost guaranteed a great image no matter how dodgy the lighting. The Galaxy Note5’s camera is also ideal for quick snaps with its “quick launch” feature where a simple double tap on the home button will get you into the dedicated camera app letting you style-snap that fashionista walking down the sidewalk. When you have time to set up that perfect shot, head on into Pro Mode where you will have full access to exposure value (EV), shutter speed, ISO, white balance, and focal distance levels for optimal image capturing. 
With that amazing rear shooter, Samsung also upgraded its front facing camera to a 5-megapixel one that maintains the rear’s HDR feature, bringing selfies to a whole new level. Join your precious moments and never have to worry about poor lighting again. Want to record a video instead? No problem. The Galaxy Note5’s small form factor coupled with the camera’s optical image stabilisation makes it ideal for handheld video recording. The bundled auto-eject S Pen makes video editing a breeze with its pressure sensitive point designed to give precision during editing. With live streaming being all the rage now, the Galaxy Note5’s camera gives users a Live Broadcast option, streaming video from either camera directly to live stream sites like YouTube. As the app is native, it eliminates potential sign-in problems giving the user instant recording. 
Sometimes simply capturing images aren’t enough to capture a moment, so the S Pen lets users personalise their photos and edit on the fly with Screen Write and Photo Editor. Add that little context to an image to make it stand out and just be that little more special. Scribble a memory or even directions on images of popular landmarks so that you will never forget that awesome moment. 
Once that’s done and dusted, share your amazing, personalised photos with the world through social media. Make sure that everyone can experience that moment with you because let’s face it, moments are like a good meal, best enjoyed in great company. In the case that you’d like to take a look at what the creative individuals can do with the Note5, here’s an amazing example: To encourage the capturing of moments and budding creative individuals, Samsung Malaysia will be running their Moment of Note campaign from the 7th of November to the 13th of December where two lucky participants will walk away with a brand new Galaxy Note5. For further enquiries check out their   @SamsungMobileMY. So what are you waiting for? Capture that Moment of Note right now and remember to add the hashtag #momentofnote #GalaxyNote5 and tag @SamsungMobileMY!"

But as more images surface, we’re still doubting if this particular smartphone will actually be the  . Anyhow consumers still have nothing to lose, we’re still getting fresh glimpses of a   device from China’s regulatory agency,  . As you can tell, it’ll have a fingerprint sensor on the rear and some metal to go along with it, a first for any Xiaomi device out there (  and   were only metal edged). We would think that Xiaomi wouldn’t kick themselves in the butt, as it seems far-fetched for them to try out something so different on a Redmi – placing it on a flagship device would likely bring more promise and also the Redmi name has attached itself to a moniker so distinct that this would be a 180-degree turn around. Another thing we had noticed was, if this were to be a Redmi device, then why did they remove the red coloured capacitive buttons? Doesn’t make much sense, unless they want to move away from the Redmi platform and make the Xiaomi brand more uniform. Believe what you may, these are all leaks; so there’s no actual word from Xiaomi. Bar none, if it is truly the Redmi Note 2 Pro, it’ll carry the same specs as its predecessor. Translating to a MediaTek Helio X10 processor underneath the 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen. It’s purported to have 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal memory, while there will be a 13-megapixel shutter on the rear. Moving your way up front, you’ll be greeted by a 5-megaxpiel sensor. Once a realisation comes about, you’ll see that handing the smartphone a metal build means that there won’t be any chances of removing the 3060 mAh battery inside. If it stands as it is, the phone will have a selling price of US$ 172 (RM 753) – that’s if it really is another Redmi product. We apologise for the cynicism but things aren’t adding up on our end. More so since Xiaomi just brought the Redmi Note 2 to Malaysia (and other emerging markets). Rumours, maintain their bad rep; at least for this moment of time. We’ll have to wait to see what Xiaomi has to say about all this, which they likely won’t, since it fuels interest in the brand. One has to hand it to them, now everyone is merely guessing what their next move is and this witch-hunt is getting quite fun.

Trusting leaked information on their firmware codenames, it might mean a release earlier than usual. Looking at industry trends, Samsung has recently fast-tracked their products by a month or so – e.g. the release of Samsung’s Galaxy Note5, in contrast to its predecessor. Accordingly, the unreleased device(s) should lead to better processors, though will it be the   8890, the   or both? We’ve seen these Korean devices be outfitted with two different chipsets before; mainly specific to regions but they skipped it for two generations, when the two options were last seen on the Galaxy Note4. A revival would be in order, as Qualcomm has stepped their game back to norm with the Snapdragon 820 (that was released today). Riding other waves, Samsung might also consider lodging a bigger screen, enticing folks who’d prefer more screen real-estate. There are also some (crazy) reports going around stating that the company will launch two different screen variants of the Galaxy S7 edge at the same time – at this time, it doesn’t make sense for Samsung to release the larger version, once you consider the S6 edge+ has only been around for a while. We’ve also discussed the potential for the latest Samsung offerings to be equip with the class-leading USB Type-C, a 3D Touch/Pressure Sensitive display and a 20-megapixel ISOCELL sensor as well. You can revisit our post about the assumed spec-sheet  . Spotted as G930FXXU0AOK6 and G935FXXU0AOK6, these are the latest leaks that support the theory that there will be two different versions of the Galaxy S7 (one regular, and the other a dual edged display). It is purported that they will begin the developmental stages for the software, from this month onwards. In the past the current line-up used SM-G920 and SM-G925 as internal codenames, so the G930 and G935 wouldn’t surprise anyone to be anything other than their successors. Phonearena has highlighted that 12 months ago, the Galaxy S6’s final firmware didn’t begin till December, so implications can be made that the Galaxy S7 line should be out just in time for MWC 2016, in February.

The Korean smart phone maker isn’t going to bring its launch earlier and there’s no reason for them to rush since the Galaxy Note5 is still a worthy flag bearer for now.

Following the notion that bigger is better, the iPad Pro is the largest iPad yet spanning 12.9 inches with a display that does 2732×2048 resolution at 264 ppi.  The iPad Pro is designed to be a mobile powerhouse with a A9X chip under the hood that’s accompanied by a M9 co-processor. Also thrown in is a 8MP iSight camera and a front facing 1.2MP camera. It gets dual-mics and 4 speakers with one placed in each corner. With a larger screen, it is heavier at 713g for WiFi and 723g for the Cellular version. However they have managed to keep the bulk down to a mere 6.9mm, which is thinner than the earlier iPad Air (7.5mm).  Apple claims that the iPad Pro display is the most advanced Retina display ever built. Apart from pushing an ultra high resolution display, it is able to track the Pencil’s input at 240 times per second, giving it a lag free response. On top of that, the display not only detects Pencil movement and pressure, but also the amount of tilt for a more realistic stroke effect that’s critical for illustrators.

The iPad Pro comes in Gold, Silver and Space Grey colours.  In terms of accessories, it will cost you quite a bit at RM799 for the Smart Keyboard and RM429 for the stylus Pencil. So at the bare minimum, that’s RM4,398 for an iPad Pro 32GB WiFi with a keyboard. If you plan on doing serious work, a   11″ can be yours from RM4,099, while the bigger 13″ version starts from RM4,549.

It hasn’t even hit stores in the States, so let’s not be too impatient; the Redmond-based company already mentions a 20  of November release, in their native US market. But if the  were to arrive in Malaysia on the 19 , we don’t think they’ll have one amazing gala, rather they’d build up anticipation of their devices gradually. Skimming through SIRIM, if you’d search for the model number RM-1116, the following information would be available to you: Saving you the trouble of digging through the spec-sheet, here’s what to expect from the Lumia 950 XL; for starters, it’ll carry a QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED 5.7-inch ClearBlack display, while on top you’ll find Gorilla Glass 4 to protect it from abrasions. Running all processes, is a 2.0GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, together with 3GB of RAM and 32GBs of on-board memory. If that doesn’t sit well with you, there’s a microSD slot for expandability up to 200GB – but believe us, if you’re going to be shooting 4K content, it’ll be a life saver. The PureView camera is back and this time it’s a 20-megapixel f/1.9 lens on the rear, equip with triple-LED RGB flash for less harsh illumination of your photos. You’ll find optical image stabilisation on board as well, that will come in handy taking quick shots with the dedicated camera button. When recording those 4K videos, you’ll be able to shoot up to 30fps and for audio quality, it’ll be supported by the 4 microphones using Lumia’s Rich Recording technology. Selfies on the other hand, will be taken with a 5-megapixel wide angle f/2.4 shooter, which allows Full HD video recording for video calls. To top it all off, it comes with a 3,340mAh battery and will give you Qi Wireless charging, if you prefer the no cable route. We’d like to think that you might stick with the old-school method since it’ll get you 0% to 50% in half an hour, through the USB Type-C port. It also ticks all the boxes for internal connectivity options – 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and 4G LTE. From our perspective, Malaysians should expect our local Microsoft to release the two Lumia devices concurrently, after the Surface Pro 4 launch. Based on currency conversions you should expect the Lumia 950 XL to cost roughly RM 2,813 but obviously, no official prices have been announced. We’ll keep you updated once we get official news from the manufacturer, regarding the Lumia devices. Till then, feel free to let us know your thoughts about how the Windows mobile platform is progressing/digressing in the comments below."

Priced from RM3,599.  The iPad Pro is the largest and the most expensive iOS device that Apple has ever built. At 12.9 inches and the option to add on a keyboard and a “Pencil” stylus, it is obvious that Apple is jumping on the convergence bandwagon. This coming Wednesday, 11th November, Apple will be making the iPad Pro available across 40 countries including Malaysia through the online store. If you prefer to feel it before parting ways with your money, Apple says you can get it from their stores and authorised resellers by the end of this week.   In terms of price, the iPad Pro cost nearly as much as a MacBook Air. The base 32GB WiFi model is going for US$799 (about RM3,505) while the 128GB version goes for US$949 (about RM4,164). For complete connectivity, the extra cellular (3G/4G) support with 128GB storage carries a hefty US$1079 (about RM4,734) price tag. As comparison, the 11″ MacBook Air is going for US$899 or RM4,099 in our Malaysian online Apple Store (after recent price revision).  To complete your iPad Pro experience, the matching keyboard cover and pencil are sold separately. The Pencil stylus that lasts 12 hours on a single charge is sold at US$99 (about RM434), while the Smart keyboard will set you back by US$169 (about RM741). The overall iPad Pro full package is really expensive and it makes the already pricey   seem like a bargain. The biggest difference of course is that the iPad Pro is still running on iOS while the Surface gives you a full fledged Windows 10 experience.

Basing his analysis on Foxconn’s recent deal to build LTPS TFT-LCDs in Zhengzhou and a company’s insights that LCDs will still be around for 3 years at minimum, it seems like a bad idea for Apple to forgo such investments. It’ll be clearly nonsensical to pursue OLEDs, if Apple’s deal means that Foxconn were to partner to the government of Henan for the aforementioned project. Kuo’s reputation exceeds his name but if the company were to consider OLEDs, they’d see a great improvement in battery life, while they’ve mediated that issue quite well with how efficient   runs; while still having lower capacity batteries compared to their competitors.

On the other hand ,to a timepiece aficionado the brand is usually the butt of jokes but its heritage is world-renown. Same goes for their ability to innovate; streamlining the chronograph just one illustration. Somewhere down the line, they’ve lost their footing and are trying once again appeal to the wider consumer base. How can they turn it around with the   Connected? Jan-Claude Biver the CEO has officially announced how much this luxury watch will go for – setting you back a cool US$ 1,500 (RM 6,581), this wearable better be worth the money. If you ask us personally, knowing that your buying a TAG at that price (even if it doesn’t have the Swiss-made seal of approval) is a good deal; a quick run through some of their most affordable models and you’ll see that the starting price hover around the US$ 1k mark. Obviously geared for a posher market, Mr Biver was quoted to say that it’ll be similar to the  , in terms of what it can do, though you shouldn’t in any way compare the two together. “I forbid my colleagues to say Apple is our competitor” – as said by the CEO. The titanium built Carrera inspired Connected will run pretty much like other smartwatches by wirelessly connecting to your smartphone for a wide array of features. On your wrist this 46mm beast will be relatively large when compared to the biggest Apple Watch at 42mm. It might even be larger than the 46mm  , as far as we can tell from photos. Ladies, if you’re into the whole smart wearable luxury segment (if that existed prior to this – no we aren’t gonna bother comparing to the US$ 17,000 Apple Watch), the Swiss makers have plans to fashion a smaller version in the future. Admittedly, TAG Heuer have mentioned for the time being, their main market base are for males. Those on the edge of heritage, craftsmanship and tradition who’d want to try out a named smartwatch can give this wearable a go for 2 years; after which, if you decide its not for you, a US$ 1,500 top up will get you a trade-up/in to a traditional mechanical Carrera. Keep in mind that Carreras retail way over US$ 3,000, a worthy bargain if you have the cash to splash. Running on the   platform, you’ll have access to some special watch faces and some dedicated apps to help you with dining options and golf tracking. It’s has a 1.5-inch LCD sapphire glass screen at 360 x 360 resolution and come with 4GB of internal storage. Paying a pretty penny for this smartwatch, it leaves out an important piece that you’d expect to get for its price; an optical heart-rate sensor. Considering you aren’t too bummed out, it does however house a gyroscope, tilt detection sensor, microphone, haptic engine and a 410 mAh battery (that TAG Heuer promises will get you 30 hours of battery-life). With Intel-inside, it’ll run a 1.6GHz dual-core Atom processor mated to 1GB of RAM. For connectivity, there’s Wi-Fi (B/G/N) and Bluetooth 4.0 to pair with your iOS 8 (or higher) device or at least an Android running version 4.3 (and up). Big tech giants   and   both had some part in creating the smartwatch, proving that it could be a formidable time piece. It’ll hit New York first, available in 6 watch strap options, with only 1,000 units for sale, while Europe will see it in similar fashion 3 days after."

Following the onslaught of who’s the “best”, “widest” and “fastest” 4G LTE network, Maxis aims to put this issue to bed by releasing company data on how they classify their 4G LTE network. Moreover, the green coloured telco has also proposed to have a forum with two of its competitors to talk about the state of 4G LTE in Malaysia. Getting the ball rolling on a pressing issue that has left Malaysian baffled by both telcos claims (Digi and Maxis), this could mean that consumers will at the end gain more out of this. The initiator of all this has issued an open invitation to any member of the public to prove them wrong on their “widest” 4G LTE network; they also hope Digi and Celcom follow suit. Setting the date for the 23  of November, Maxis hopes that this platform will allow all three networks to have their own telecommunications engineers to talk about how they gauge their coverage. And at the end of the day, Maxis claims that they want to do this for consumers; evidently to let us “have a fair basis for choosing”. Strangely, Maxis has left out the 4  major player in the market, U Mobile. Possibly since the company isn’t publicly listed, otherwise we’d best not speculate further. While everyone claims to provide the “widest” 4G LTE, we’re still questioning if they’ve diverted their attention to problems that their customers are facing everyday – even in the heart of the Klang Valley. Our readers have been very open about their experiences on their networks, with some stating that there are service blind spots in popular landmarks and areas around the major cities. Silly if you think of it really, the fact that their customers in their key market areas are facing issues and they want to go on record being the “widest”, “fastest”, and “best” network. Previously, we talked about what all these bold titles mean to consumers, you can check it out  . But if you’re really into these figures that Maxis has published, they are listed below: It’s easy to talk numbers and standards but do they really reflect in real-life situations?

When analysing which platform is safer, two security firms have looked at how secure the   and   platforms are. The results may surprise you, but how worried should we be? And what cautionary steps should be taken? Users that dabble in third-party app stores (should) know what they’re doing, especially when it concerns workarounds and an unauthorised market place for apps. Bountiful in choices in countries like China and Russia, some of these apps are obviously laden with hidden malware and that’s where the official sources,   and the  , vets them. Conventional thought has always made Apple the king when it comes to supplying the most secure operating system (  or iOS). Nevertheless, a new study provides some surprising insights that iOS is 4% more prone to vulnerable attacks compared to Android. The breakdown of the numbers is as listed below: Partly due to the amazing growth of the mobile ecosystem that sees nearly 1.5 million apps between the two platforms and multiple billions of downloads, this screams to be the best place for hackers to have some fun – at our expense. Extending way beyond instant messaging and social media, apps have evolved to include these sectors; banking and medicine, just to name a few. Dedicated detection in-built into apps would be one of the most promising course of action for smartphone vendors. It doesn’t help either that mobile OS’ run in a sandbox environment. To simplify what that means, you’re letting an application do what it needs to, in a secure setting. There are restrictions, so for example if you were to use an anti-spyware/malware app on your device, it can only do so much – now restricted by the operating system instead of the other way around. For a more thorough explanation head on over  . Always ensure that the apps you download are from reputable developers, especially if you’re on an Android device. In a sense, iOS is more tightly overseen when giving power to developers, so that’s a smaller sandbox and vetting them before going live on the App Store. While   also has its own process, it isn’t as stringent as   – case and point, no validity for Play Store apps. It’s understandable that with a fairly open-sourced platform, Android will have its trade-offs when it concerns pushing out security updates but hopefully   solves this. OEMs have jumped on the idea of providing monthly security updates, as far as  ,   and   is concerned.

In essence, Trivoly attaches itself underneath your regular watch, so nothing odd happens to your original timepiece – it does however, pack some great features in its small body. It secures itself on to the underside of your watch via Gecko-tape, a derivative of a suction cup mechanism. Measuring just 3mm thin, you’re likely to notice a bump but not by much. Once placed, it’ll sync up to your smartphone and provide notifications by vibrating or lighting up its LEDs to correspond to your settings. Trivoly’s UI lives inside an app, allowing you to do some great things when you tap around your watch face (actually the side of the disc but it’s all the same). The app lets you personalise your notifications by setting different colours and vibration patterns. There’s also a discreet function to avoid certain interruptions by prioritising the contacts you’ve managed. Inside the disc lives an optical heart rate sensor and accelerometer to support your fitness lifestyle by enabling advanced tracking for exercise on the dedicated app. Other features included are multimedia controls for apps like SONOS, iTunes and Spotify by taping from the top, bottom, left and right – each functioning differently and acting as a remote control of sorts. Lastly, it’ll also act as a wireless picture taking controller; up to 25 feet away, a simple tap will start a countdown timer and after 3 seconds a photo is taken. Hypo allergenic in nature and water resistant, the manufacturer promises the device will give you up to 4 days of battery life. Currently, it supports iPhone 5’s (and up) on iOS 8 or later, as well as Android smartphones that run at least 4.2 (and up). There will be two versions of the Trivoly, as the low end variant doesn’t have the fitness tracker component. At this current time, Trivoly 1 costs US$ 99 (RM 427), while the higher-end Trivoly 2 goes for US$ 129 (RM 556). The makers promise to have the device shipped to you in February 2016. Trivoly’s invention should be compared to the   – that offers almost the same thing (minus the camera, music control option and smaller form factor) and that only costs RM 69 (that’s nearly 6 times less), so choose wisely if you’re interested in pledging.

It has the same 5″ size but gets notable upgrades to qualify as a decent mid-range smart phone.  Instead of a Snapdragon 410 processor, the Moto G Turbo Edition gets bumped up with a Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core unit with 2GB of RAM. While the display size remains unchanged, it pushes a higher Full HD resolution, giving a flagship class screen clarity. On-board it still gets 16GB of storage which is also expandable. The camera set up is the same as the standard Moto G with a 13MP f/2.0 main camera and a front facing f/2.2 unit. Connectivity wise, there’s 802.11n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, 4G LTE support and it also packs a 2,470mAh capacity battery. To protect itself from accidental splashes, the Moto G Turbo Edition has IP67 water/dust resistance as well. Similar to Nexus devices, it runs on stock Android with version 5.1.1 Lollipop.

The current   which   for RM89 is quite a heft at 350 grams and Xiaomi has managed to make the new 20,000mAh version lighter at only 338 grams. That’s even lighter than two of the latest   that weighs 207 gram each. The design is different from its current models as it uses polycarbonate materials instead of the usual metal, contributing to its massive weight reduction. To provide better grip, the power bank has a perforated texture on top which Xiaomi claims to be scratch resistant. Like the 16,000mAh version, there are two USB outputs, that pushes a maximum of 5.1V/3.6A combined. It is even capable of charging a USB Type-C enabled MacBook up to 1.2X. A 4-LED battery level indicator is retained at the top, while the power/status button has been shifted to the side. Knowing that 20,000mAh will take almost eternity to charge up to full, it supports quick charge supporting 5V/2A, 9V/1.2A and 12V/1.5A. In just 3 hours, you would have gotten 11,000mAh charged, compared to its 10,000mAh power bank that does 5,000mAh in the same duration.

Although lacking a display, the original   was really affordable – RM 59 at the time of launch. We’re hoping that the new tech inside won’t make a huge price difference, once it arrives in Malaysia but more on that later. The new wearable could give other more expensive activity trackers a run for their money, since adding the optical heart-rate sensor.  Pretty much everything else is the same but if you need a further recap, the older model’s features are still maintained with the step counter and sleep monitor.

From the purported leaked image shown above, the One X9 looks like an evolution of its HTC Butterfly series. The top and bottom grill indicates the presence of its Boom Sound speakers and surprisingly it appears to have capacitive buttons in front. That’s rather odd since HTC smart phone these days have opted for on-screen buttons. It is alleged that it will carry a 5″ display that pushes a Quad HD (2560×1440) resolution with either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 or Helio X20 processor running on -board. The rumour continues with a massive 4GB of RAM, a 23MP main + 4MP Ultrapixel camera bombo and a generous on-board storage of 64GB to 128GB. Breaking its tradition of using smaller than average batteries, the One X9 is said to be fitted with a larger 3,500mAh capacity unit.

New photos have arrived showing the outer shell and it pretty much corroborates older images but still leave us unsure if   would pack all this in a mid-range device. Since the   will be available (in Malaysia) for pre-order in 2 days, this timely news might deter buyers who’d prefer a metal-clad phablet. That said, if the rumours are true, the Redmi Note 2 Pro could carry a 5.5-inch display but no information states whether it’ll maintain the 1080p resolution like the regular variant. Once you find your way inside, there will be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor coupled with either of these memory configurations: 2GB RAM + 16GB internal storage – 1099 yuan (RM 756) 
3GB RAM + 32GB internal storage – 1299 yuan (RM 893) 
4GB RAM + 64GB internal storage – 1499 yuan (RM 1030) Something definitely doesn’t tally with this information but from photos we can say that a device does indeed exist. Whether it’ll actually be a Redmi Note 2 Pro is a whole other story. Firstly, it doesn’t make sense to pack a fingerprint sensor and premium build, in a mid-range product – if you were to do it, it would definitely be in your flagship. Another problem would be, why release a higher-end Redmi Note 2 if you just released it in August. But then again, we feel it won’t be anything else since the   was supposed to be a “respectable “replacement to the Mi 4. If Xiaomi truly decides to release a device with the aforementioned price points, this could be the most expensive Redmi to date.

Most recently,   owners have taken to reddit to voice their concerns and experiences with the device. As we all know, the latest Nexus has glass on the back (a very small part) for its rear camera and other sensors. But what you wouldn’t expect is the rear glass panel suddenly cracking for no reason. First encountered by a reddit user by the name “jonny_rat”, the owner recalls his experience, thus raising some huge concerns about how   went into making these panels. The way jonny pictures it, the device was on a table, unattended and suddenly for no reason the glass just cracked. He isn’t alone as other users have also reported the panel splitting unexpectedly without fault or impact. Here are more photos below for you to take a look: A lot of science goes into the making of these intricate components, especially when you have a manufacturer like Corning involved. Though it’ll be tough to verify if these claims are true, and most importantly if no user error was involved. Until more reports surface or Google/Huawei makes an official statement, we’ll just have to rest on our laurels. These problems highlight a key complication with metal unibody devices, since metal as an element is more reactive to temperatures, humidity and air pressure compared to polycarbonate and other plastics. Huawei’s graceful entry into metal devices ( ,   and  ) and eventual Nexus 6P was bound to bump into some issues along the road, so this wasn’t entirely unexpected. Bend-gate has been a thing since the iPhones and stress testing devices with this forceful (literal) methodology could now be seen as a “standard” for tech enthusiast. By now, mostly everyone interested would’ve seen the two bend tests by  . The YouTuber in question took the Nexus 6P to its limits, halving the phablet in the process. Some individuals doubted the authenticity of the video and the way he went upon testing but after releasing a  , more people have started to consider that maybe Huawei’s device isn’t as tough as it’s assumed. The news is definitely worrying for potential buyers to know, however a quick   on YouTube will show you people trying the same thing but failing to bend the phones – adding more drama to the whole situation. As users ourselves, it’s painful to watch anyone destroy a piece of tech but it’s nice to know that these people do it so we don’t have to. Let’s hope Huawei and Google explain themselves soon enough (like   did) since Malaysians might get the latest Nexus line by year end. The smartphone industry has to brace themselves as consumers find out new ways to point out design flaws in their products, they’ll either have to toughen up their products or substitute it with a material that can hold up to these tests.

While the camera equipment to get a shot like this running will cost a bomb, so there isn’t much readily available videos just yet. The second add-on is where things get a little more interesting. So if you’ve noticed on your Android device that there’s a symbol in the settings that you’ve never seen before, give it a go.

If you aren’t familiar with the Cardboard UI, it halves the screen, shrinks the video and mirrors it on the two sides.

That extends to any messaging service, be it Whatsapp, Facebook chat and the like, you don’t know if the data flow is secure. That’s where Celcom’s Zipit Chat comes in, being the most secure communications app you’ll ever lay your eyes on.  The reason? It’s because it uses Military-Grade AES256 Encryption. 
Like we mentioned earlier, Zipit Chat utilises Military-Grade AES256 Encryption, which keeps your chats very private by encrypting your messages to the point that even snooping security agencies won’t be able to break the code. Even your emails can be encrypted in a similar manner, with attachments of up to 10MB for videos and emails. So if someone manages to intercept it, all they’ll see is piles of gibberish. Your phonebook information will also be secure, and with this app screen capture is disabled for extra measure. 
Celcom ran a contest a little over a month ago that got people to attempt to decrypt three messages that have been encrypted by Zipit Chat and the results were pretty off the mark. While the text isn’t completely vulnerable to brute-forcing but it can only be decrypted with a secret key that’s specific to that text alone. It could take years for someone to figure it out otherwise! So if you’re looking for something that even the government won’t be able to get into, Zipit Chat is right for you."

No matter in voice, video or text, we’ve all found new ways to get our messages across. Words fly across our screens all the time, especially in our instant messaging apps, but are letters enough? Do they allow individuals to express themselves well? If you feel you’ve always used Emojis more often than just plain text, you should take a look at the keyboard by EmojiWorks’. Usually our access to Emojis face an issue when it comes to PC compatibility, or at least non-mobile devices; unless you get a program that lets you display an on-screen keyboard. The list of these images/Emojis are constantly expanding and our need for them could be just cause they add more life into a conversation. Opening doors and new avenues with the Bluetooth enabled Emoji keyboard, EmojiWorks has begun taking pre-orders for the chiclet based typing slate and it’ll come in 3 options. The base model will get you 47 emojis; the Plus model hands you double, access to more than one skin tone option; the Pro version gets you almost triple the original emojis with 120 icons. These keyboards will come with the latest emoji icons (up to the last refresh) and it’ll be compatible with Apple products (Mac OS X and iOS) and Windows running machines (tablets, and PCs). The basis of having a keyboard would be allowing you to type in QWERTY format, and it gives you the same A-Z plus symbols and functionality as a regular keyboard – it’ll be smaller than most, since it rids itself of the numberpad keys. All three keyboards run on 2 AAA batteries and there’s an EmojiWorks specific software that you’ll have to install to get the emojis on your screen. Starting from US $79.95 (Emoji Keyboard), the mid-range model will cost US$ 89.95, while the top of the line Pro model will be just shy of US$ 100. They begin shipping in December. Has technology derailed the proper meaning of communication, to the point that humans are losing a piece of themselves in the process? Are these emojis merely images that don’t really reflect our actual emotions? Maybe we should backtrack and revert to the most personal way of communicating, at least then we’d all be more genuine. Let us know what you think about this keyboard and its impending affects on human communication in the comments below."

As a display-less band, it won’t serve you any time-telling information, nor will it give any real-time tracking, so it might add extra heft to your existing watch-filled wrist. The predecessor didn’t have a HRM, basically only offering you notification for calls, texts and other apps. There’s an accelerometer living inside the shell of the smartwatch, so it’ll track walking, running and other movement related activities. All your info will be viewed on the manufacturer’s Lifelog app, giving you a detailed insight into how much you’ve been moving around – or lack thereof. Sony also throws in a sleep tracker that monitors how well your slumber sessions are and is also enabled with a smart alarm clock, that vibrates on cue.

Issuing the who’s better   within a short period, the two have been bitten by a bug to prove who has the true widest 4G LTE network. Question is, when telcos claim to have the widest coverage would you gauge it based on population percentile or percentage of coverage areas? Who sets the standards? And most important of all, does it matter? To get to the bottom of this, we’ll have to set some key definitions first about what 4G LTE is. In a data-driven generation, we all emphasis speed and with that speed comes the necessary technology to support our thirst for it. Malaysians have gotten a taste of 4G LTE in 2013 and were offered by Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. Referring to the specifications set by the United Nation’s official oversight commission (ITU-R) that monitors information and communication technologies; 4G LTE at its truest ( ) would translate to 100 Mbps on the move, and roughly 1 Gbps when considered locally wireless. At least, in theory that is. Looking around the globe at some of the fastest speeds, none of them break the 40 Mbps mark. Referring to Open Signal’s “ ” report, these are the top 5 countries with the fastest (average) LTE speeds: New Zealand is the chart topper, posting 36Mbps; Singpore gets runner-up with 33Mbps; Romania surprisingly gets 30Mbps; South Korea gets the 4th spot with 29Mbps; Denmark rounds off the 5th spot with 26Mbps. Since the report refers to data from September, the info is backdated. Interestingly, Open Signal only has a sample size of approx. 300 thousand users – yes, a size quite small when you’re talking global proportions. In retrospect, Malaysian usually see a range of 15Mbps to 30Mbps but there have been instances where you’ll see a spike that actually meets the aforementioned standards. Surpassing and reaching LTE-Advance levels, which puts Maxis at the forefront (for the time being). Both sides will have a valid say, for example, what use would there be if you traveled to a desolated area in some deep jungle in the peninsular or eastwards? It’d be pointless (in a sense) to erect a cell tower in that area, because there wouldn’t be anyone to serve. But at the same time, if anyone were to be placed in that situation, aren’t they supposed to be covered, if their mobile operator is indeed the widest? Taking a look at the playing field, both telcos above (actually the major 4) run on the even platform – two spectrums: 1800GHz and 2600GHz. Ironically when 4G LTE was first rolled out, the iPhone 5 wasn’t able to run on LTE, as all networks were solely running on 2600GHz at the time. Lower bands get you better signal penetration (indoors and outdoors) but higher bands give you faster data speeds. In a race to the top, are telco providers forgetting that unless there is a way to quantify and verify their 4G LTE population coverage, it just simply an unrecognised title to hold? Do they deliver as promised? From our comments on Digi’s and Maxis’ coverage articles, many users are still facing service related issues. They’ve attached   for reference, testing their speeds in claimed areas and disputing them accordingly. For customer experience to be considered, our local telco players tend to knock about the notion of providing the best but are they really delivering? Nationwide, many users have voiced out about drops in cellular quality but we’d rather hear your thoughts; many factors go into objectively testing networks around Malaysia but with our readers coming from all over, we hope to get some feedback and your concerns to your providers and let them address them. Should Malaysian cellular providers bother in claiming the top coverage(s) title? They should first mediate issues that are faced by their users on a day-to-day basis – delivering what users need, consistently giving them the value they paid for in the first place. If we were to take part in a full-blown test that manages to encapsulate the varying telcos and their corresponding ability to cover areas, there would be many puzzles pieces and putting them together would include: Taking a respective number of locations – e.g. over 100 locations nationwide (East Malaysia and West Malaysia) 
Using the same device, test the four telcos cellular data coverage 
Establish if there is 4G LTE in the area through corresponding symbols on these devices 
Test their speeds, take multiple tests on each network and get an average 
Find out if these 4G speeds are better than 3G HSPA+ or even lower bands (cause if it isn’t, what’s the point of having the widest 4G coverage?) 2G, 3G, 4G and whatever else that goes along with your user experience, it should be maintained across all their offerings, not being better here or coming short on the other. U Mobile has proven that while they were the new player, they’ve established a foothold in their 3G HSPA+ network with 4G-like speeds. We’re sure that users have had moments where nothing can be done on 3G (even with good coverage in that category). We have to start questioning the reasons why our providers are busy worrying about widest and fastest? Users would much prefer something tangible, and at the end of the day if their telcos work for them in their corresponding areas. Throwing marketing fluff here and there does nothing for their consumers."

Even with TM’s new Unifi plans that offer  , many had frown upon the removal of its cheaper 5Mbps option at RM149/month.  For those with the need for speed, it can get ridiculously expensive. Maxis offers   for a colossal RM398/month. Alternatively, TIME is also   at a cheaper RM179/month but it comes with a 100GB cap.  Is there a way for Malaysians to get faster speeds at lower prices? A Singaporean broadband company wants to make it possible when it comes to Malaysia.  MyRepublic that’s based in Singapore has caused quite a stir by offering 1Gbps of fibre internet for as low as S$49/month (about RM150) during its debut. It was a deal you can’t refuse as the other players were charging as high as S$395/month (about RM1215) for the same speed. It didn’t take too long before the existing incumbents started slashing prices to match MyRepublic’s offering.  Even today, MyRepublic is offering   for home users at only S$59.99 (about RM185) per month. On top of that, they are also coming up as the   in Singapore, with unlimited high speed quota. Apart from Singapore, they are also in   offering as high as 1Gbps at NZ$89.99/month (about RM261).  As reported by  , MyRepublic is planning to enter Malaysia with the ambition to offer 100Mbps connectivity for around RM60-RM70 a month. Its CEO Malcolm Rodrigues wants to be very disruptive in the market and they are eager to take up the disruptor role in our local scene. The timing however depends on our regulatory environment, and they are looking forward for TM to open up its network access by 2016.  At the moment, other fibre broadband players such as Maxis and P1 are tapping onto the same HSBB network as TM but they are basically wholesale deals which isn’t ideal for MyRepublic. In their expansion into Malaysia and other markets, they had  , who is the former CEO of P1 and TM Net.  Can MyRepublic disrupt our local broadband scene? 100Mbps at RM60/month sounds insane especially when TM charges double for a mere 1Mbps ADSL service. If Maxis could deliver   from as low as RM118/month, undercutting TM’s UniFi service on the same network, it won’t be surprising.  Like most new ventures, they could offer broadband below cost just to rake the numbers in. For example When telco 3 entered Australia, they had offered loads of free calls, heavily subsidised device offers and lower barrier to entry even for foreign subscribers in order to pull the masses onto their fold. Can MyRepublic make a difference in Malaysia? Let us know what do you think in the comments below."

But what does the Vowney bring to the table? If the title didn’t catch your attention, the rest just might. The Vowney (an odd name choice) has a 5.5-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) display, while a 64-bit 2.2GHz MediaTek Helio X10 is behind the smartphone’s brains.

Also found on the back is a 21-megapixel Sony sensor equip with Phase Detection Auto Focus and 4K video recording capabilities. Flip it over and you’ll see an 8-megapixel sensor up front.

The Samsung Galaxy View which was   is a gigantic 18.4″ tablet that runs on Android. This isn’t your typical Android tablet and it even comes a kickstand at the back.  According to Samsung, this opens up new ways of consuming mobile video and entertainment. And possibly they are trying to create a cross product between a TV and a tablet.  The display does Full HD resolution in 16:9 aspect ratio, which gives it a rather low 119ppi (pixels per inch). Since it is focused as a video consumption device, it also gets a pair of stereo speakers and underneath it runs on a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM. On-board it gets either 32GB or 64GB of storage with the option to add more via a microSD slot. For video conference purposes, it has a 2.1MP front facing camera and if you need to use it while on the go, it has a 5,700mAh battery that’s rated to last 8 hours of video playback. There’s also Bluetooth 4.1, WiFi 802.11ac and a NanoSIM slot (LTE Version) for your connectivity needs.  While it is considered a portable Android device, the Galaxy View is quite a heft at 2.65kg and overall it is 11.9mm thick. The kickstand doesn’t seem to be foldable but Samsung still claims that it is versatile for either a stand mode or typing mode, when placed lying down.  The Galaxy View runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop but the interface is said to be a video-centric one that primarily showcases video content. If we can sum this up, this is basically a tablet+TV hybrid.

This cuts out Digi’s widest   by 5% and will bring great news to all smartphone users on the Maxis network. In Q3 alone, Maxis allocated RM 359 million to increase its LTE coverage nationwide. Exceeding 55% of the current population of Malaysia, now allows them to hold the widest 4G LTE network title in the country. That accounts for 95% of coverage across key market centres and 60% in all state capitals.

Oddly, the   looks to be a   on the inside, just taking a hit in battery and screen size, while adding some notable features and aesthetics. Unfortunately, Shenzhen’s “finest” have decided to deploy the same notorious invite system but there’s an improvement. The X runs their home-grown Oxygen OS based on Android 5.1.1 and there are two materials that differentiate the pair; Onyx and Ceramic. Making the device smaller, this time 5-inches, it carries an AMOLED display with a FHD resolution and has Gorilla Glass 3 plastered on top for protection. Repeating the usage of the Snapdragon 801 on their latest device, it’ll see only 32-bit processing, something that was acceptable on the OnePlus One but causes some concern looking at the latest crop of devices popping up. Continuing the trend, it has the same amount of RAM too, 3GB; which in this day and age, still holds up fine, though there’s only 16GB of expandable internal storage. In the past none of their models had a microSD slot, so this might mean that OnePlus could include expandability in the future devices. Changing it up this time around, they’ve added a hybrid dual-SIM functionality, that gives you networks up to 4G LTE but keep in mind you’ll have to do without one SIM slot for your expandable storage. Its rear camera lens is a 13-megapixel sensor with an f/2.2 aperture sensor, while the front gets an 8-megapixel selfie shooter. All the power is provided by a 2,525 mAh battery and there’s the same three tier alert slider found on the higher-end OnePlus Two. The Onyx version retails for US$ 250 (RM 1,076) and the Ceramic version goes for around US$ 400 (RM 1,721). Only the former is sold in the States but otherwise they retail in the same countries worldwide. Sales will start in India on November 5th using the invite system but only for a month, after which it’ll be available for purchase without strings attached – this strategy will be mimicked across all continents.  No word when the device will hit Malaysian shores but it has already been spotted on  , so you can anticipate it to arrive by year’s end. We don’t think the Flagship Killer 2016 was a killer at all, the company which at first was painstakingly trying to keep up with demands of some 2 million reservations, may have left customers waiting too long; they probably opted for other devices by now, seeing a sudden surge of flash sales and our own Maxis selling the device   without an invitation needed. Can OnePlus last long enough to put out their version of the 2017 Flagship Killer?"

At 5-inches, it rocks a 960 x 540 resolution screen, and runs a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor.

If your internal storage runs out, there will be a microSD slot to save the day. Also available on the Neo 7 is LTE support, as both SIM slots give you up to 4G speeds. Anyone who loves photos but doesn’t have the matching cash to dish out will be relatively satisfied with the 8-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera and LED flash module. Once you move over to the front, you’ll see the 5-megapixel shutter that it uses – the screen doubles as a flash-like light source, similar to the iPhone 6s.

Backed by the Huawei  , they just might. Targeting a new market, as compared to its predecessor, it was launched at   with “Force Touch”, we won’t be getting that 128GB model but nonetheless, the Mate S is no one trick pony. It boasts a 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) AMOLED display and a familiar combination makes its way underneath the metal-only outer layer of the device; a Kirin 935 Octa-core processor, mated to 3GB of RAM. There will also be 64GB of internal memory, while its expandable through the hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slots (up-to 128GB). Its photographs are taken by a 13-megapixel RGBW rear camera equip with OIS and dual-LED flash; the front however gets an 8-megapixel shutter with an f/2.4 aperture and a single LED flash. Huawei’s signature rear fingerprint scanner is included here too for an alternative option for biometric security. In terms of software, Knuckle Sense gets an update, now version 2.0 and as per usual, allows you to interact differently through your knuckles in the form of double-tapping or drawing symbols. You’ll also notice EMUI 3.1 skinned over Android 5.1 Lollipop on the device. A 2,700 mAh battery fits inside the 156gram smartphone and will be available in two colour options, Prestige Gold and Coral Pink. The Mate S makes a big price jump as the newest edition to the Mate lineup; retracing back to the launch price of the Ascend Mate 7, it went for RM 1,999 during its launch. But, for the price you pay, Huawei wants to make it worth your money by adding these perks: And depending how early you decide to buy the device, the more you’ll get in return.

For imaging, the G8 gets a 28mm wide-angle 13-megapixel sensor on the rear and a 5-megapixel lens on the front. Akin to the Mate S, the more affordable G8 also has a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slot but has a larger 3,000 mAh battery. Mirroring its big brother, it also has EMUI 3.1 on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop for its operating system. Onto the largest of the trio, the Huawei MediaPad M2 8.0, that as the name suggests, has an 8-inch screen with the same FHD resolution (1920 x 1080). Under the hood, it houses a 64-bit Octa-core 2GHz Kirin 930 chipset and for multitasking and app switching, there’s 2GB of RAM. As a tablet, the readily available 32GB might be a stretch but at least there’s a microSD slot for expandability.  An 8-inch device being used to take photos might be a sight for sore eyes but if you really need to, there’s an 8-megapixel rear camera; used more practically for video calling a 2-megapixel sensor will be on the front. Touted to “amplify your excitement” the tablet will offer a seamless audio experience, thanks to its side-facing dual speaker set-up. Utilising Clari-Fi technology and Super Wide Sound 2.0 by Harman Kardon, the brand promises to immerse you with 180-degree surround sound.

Priced at RM 1,399 (w/ GST) it could possibly still give other devices a run for the money; but then again, it’s a year old.

After being   in certification databases of both Malaysia and Singapore, this is likely to be the official launch of the  , with sales expected to commence shortly after. 
 According to the official invite, the launch event will announce the product availability for four markets namely Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. To recap on the specs, the Redmi Note 2 is an affordable phablet that could be priced below its mainstream competitors. It features a 5.5″ Full HD display, a MediaTek Octa-Core Helio X10 processor, 2GB of RAM and likely 16GB of storage for our local market. The Redmi Note 2 also comes with an expandable microSD slot, 13MP f/2.2 main camera with PDAF and a front facing 5MP selfie camera.  On top of that, it supports faster 802.11ac WiFi and comes with an IR Blaster which can be a nifty remote control. Keeping the lights on is a removable 3,060mAh battery that supports quick charge.

Alexander Wong,Huawei Mate S: Can Huawei play the premium game?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/27/huawei-mate-s-malaysia-hands-on-first-impressions/,"Android,Dual Sim,first impressions,huawei,Huawei Mate S,Huawei Mate S First Impressions,Huawei Mate S Hands-on,Huawei Mate S Malaysia","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-27,"Huawei is certainly a brand to watch out for as they are rising to the occasion with some compelling smart phones these days. On the Huawei P8, they had elevated their build quality perceptions with a premium unibody metal design, but it isn’t as refined as its mainstream rivals. Perception isn’t built overnight but more consumers are beginning to accept the new wave of alternatives coming from China. To show the world what they are capable of, Huawei had recently announced the  , a premium device that eyes for the likes of the Galaxy Note 5 and the iPhone 6S Plus. Can they deliver? Read on to find out. At first glance, it looks like a bigger honor 7 with a full metal back that comes with a subtle curve. Upon picking it up, you’ll notice the finer details and the silky smooth surfaces that are nice to touch. Their previous P8 flagship was solid in the hands but the Mate S adds more refinement to the mix. At 7.2mm thin, it is slightly thicker than an iPhone 6s at the thickest point, but the sloping back gives a thinner feeling device at your fingertips. Looking towards the bottom, it shares the similar design as the Huawei P8 and the honor 7, with twin speaker/mic grills on each side of the micro USB port. On the left, you’ll find a dual-SIM tray slot, which is a hybrid one that accepts microSD. The volume buttons and power button are neatly placed on the right for easy reach but we felt that the power button could be larger for the perfect feel. The 5.5″ Full HD screen dominates the front with minimal clutter as it uses on-screen buttons for navigation. During its global launch, the Mate S was Huawei’s first smart phone to feature a “Force Touch” display that’s pressure sensitive but it isn’t present in our current unit. That apparently it reserved for its higher-spec model that comes with 128GB of storage. Underneath, the Huawei Mate S shares a lot of similarities with the honor 7. It runs on a high-end Kirin 935 Octa-Core 64-bit processor (2.2GHz x4, 1.5GHz x4) that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. On-board the mate S comes with 64GB of storage for Malaysia and it is expandable up to 128GB using microSD. With EMUI 3.1 that runs on top of Android 5.1.1, it runs rather smoothly without any hesitation so far. For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP camera with a 4-colour RGBW sensor that’s assisted by dual-LED flash and Optical Image Stabilisation. Similar to the P8, it gets a variety of modes including Light Painting features. The Mate S gets a new Professional Mode that offers full manual settings for extra tweaks on ISO, Manual Focus, Exposure and AWB. For taking selfies, the front gets a 8MP camera that even comes with a soft flash light for brighter looking selfies. Despite being a 2015 flagship, the main camera doesn’t support 4K videos, shooting a maximum of up to Full HD 1080p. The single down facing speaker is quite loud but the biggest feature for audio has got to be its recording capabilities. The Mate S has 3 mics in total which can be used simultaneously to record a meeting conversation with individual attendee tagging, similar to the Galaxy Note 4. In the battery department, it packs a 2,700mAh capacity unit which is slightly more than the P8 by a slight margin. Unlocking the Mate S is rather quick with its rear mounted fingerprint scanner. It unlocks instantly with a touch and it does more than just securing the device. Similar to the honor 7, you can swipe downwards to view notification. On top of that, it performs double duty as a touch pad scroller in the image gallery as well as a remote trigger when taking pictures using both main and selfie cameras. Despite not having a pressure sensitive display, the Mate S still gets a decent amount of gesture features. Apart from the usual tap to wake, it has an improve Knuckle Sense technology that lets you screen capture or crop using your knuckles. Huawei has improved it further with a quick app launch feature where you can draw a “c” using your knuckle to launch the camera or “e” to open a browser. At RM2,698, the Huawei Mate S is also the most expensive smart phone and it goes neck to neck with the Galaxy Note5 that’s priced at RM2,699. For a quick comparison, the Mate S has the upper hand with double the storage at 64GB along with the option to add more with a microSD slot. However the Note5 offers more in specs including a faster processor, more RAM, faster camera and also a productive S Pen. If performance and productivity is what you’re looking for, it is tough to recommend the Mate S over the Galaxy Note5. The decision is even tougher considering the similar spec’ed albeit the smaller screen honor 7 can be have for just RM1,399. However if you’re looking for a stylish and premium alternative that isn’t a Samsung or an Apple, the Mate S could be something worth checking out."

When the first leaks of the   came around, we too thought it was an iPhone clone but lets take a look closer at how Apple “innovates”; methods that haven’t settled well with their Taiwanese counterparts, causing one of HTC’s regional chiefs to share his two cents on the subject. Jack Tong, President of the North Asia had this to say, after the One A9 press event: A worthy case made by Tong; you’ll see what we mean when you compare the backs of the   and the  , which the former came into existence first. At the time of its instillation, the M7 was a device veered for its use of a metal unibody, to the extent that HTC kept the design language three times over –   and  . Similarities between the iPhone 6/6s (since they look the same) and the HTC One A9 may be uncanny but if you take a look at the (earlier released) HTC One M7 and M8 compared to the Apple iPhone 6, yeah its the same thing.   iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus 
HTC One M7 pictured on far left He then adds that: All this finger pointing as said earlier, isn’t Apple’s first rodeo when considering the presence it has associated with pioneering in the tech industry – heck they’re even rumoured to be entering the automotive business. When you take a look at the how the Cupertino brand markets themselves, you’ll know that people tend to think that the iDevices were the first smartphone and tablet. What of the tablets that ran Windows XP, or near field communication (NFC) tech distinctive and finger print sensors native to Japan? Both of which lead the pack way before Apple decided to hitch a ride on the same train. We could go on about what came first but do they get the credit? We feel that limelight stealing in general will continue forever. A leaked photo has given HTC executives some powerful ammunition to hand down to their underlings: Whether the market reacts positively or otherwise, we’ll have to wait but HTC is surely embracing all the free advertisement it’s getting. One thing we can be sure of is that the Taiwanese manufacturer will continue to stick to the design on the One A9; as quoted by Tong, it’ll eventually spill over to their top of the line M and Desire models."

Their latest venture in question is field-testing Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) on their 4G LTE network. 
 Boldly claiming to provide the  , capable of connecting every 1 in 2 Malaysians, Digi seeks to add more value to their services by adding VoLTE to their repertoire. Data speeds have forever been a topic of discussion amongst Malaysians, especially those who rely on their smartphones. But have we forgotten that phones were made for us to actually talk to each other? Well having said, there hasn’t been a large emphasis on call quality, since the whole experience has been fairly satisfactory, albeit some drop calls every now and then. With VoLTE these issues might soon be a thing of the past, resolving it by delivering voice calls over the 4G data network. Currently “sedentary” to be made over 2G and 3G networks, imagine having voice calls through 4G networks – will there be a difference, you ask? Ever been in an LRT and your coach is screaming away and you can’t hear the person on the other end? Well in theory, VoLTE will transmit high fidelity audio and add noise cancellation features to your calls. That means a lot more talking/listening and a lot less shouting/closing one ear to hear clearly. VoLTE will also allow users to bridge the gap of internet use while active in a voice call; giving you 4G LTE speeds whilst in both uses. Presently, you’d notice that your network switches from 4G to 2G/3G when making a call? Yup, that’s the clear example. Another benefit would be faster connection to the other end, possibly 2-3 times faster to get you connected to the person you’re calling. Digi implementation of testing is already happening behind the scenes and their subscribers can expect to make use of the better call quality on their 4G LTE enabled-smartphones next year. 2G and 3G voice calls are still enabled after the launch of VoLTE for whoever has a non-4G LTE device. Head on over   to take a look at how call quality is improved using different voice-over technologies."

There’s a chance that the Chinese manufacturer might end up revealing the   later this week during a media-only event, though the MediaPad M2 is a surprise to us all. The G8 is a handsome glass and metal mid-ranger, and has upped the ante from its predecessor; now featuring a bigger display and battery, a finger print sensor on the back and other decent internals. The 5.5-inch FHD display (1920 x 1080) boasts 2.5D cambered glass, looking like a bezel-less edge. Handling its processing is a 1.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 615, mated to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable internal storage.

This came to light as Facebook Engineer   has admitted a couple of battery related issues but he assures that a fix is on its way. There are 2 reasons why this is happening. The first issues is what he calls as a CPU Spin within their network code. Basically it is a repeated process in the background which uses more power than usual. The second problem is how the Facebook app handles audio playback. If you leave Facebook after watching a video, the audio is muted but the session is still active in the background. While it appears that nothing is happening, it continues to consume power in the background. Ari Grant had also assured that the battery issue is not caused by their optional Location history feature. For those who didn’t enable this feature, Facebook isn’t accessing your location in the background without your consent. The good news is that a new Facebook App update addressing these problems will be released later today."

Looking at the images so far we can tell you that it isn’t a sore to look at, proving that Samsung isn’t taking design for granted even if the   is touted to carry mid-range specs. A noticeable change from the Korean manufacturer is the omission of the home button, a physicality that’s been present on all previous tablets they’ve made. They opt instead for the more natural on-screen buttons that you’ll be able to see below. On the back is where things get a whole lot more interesting. The attachment comes in the form of a kickstand, which has a handle. The photos don’t reveal how its held together, if there’s a locking system or otherwise but it does show that you’ll be able to display it in a higher or lower orientation depending what you’re using it for.

The latter re-imagined how we saw the future and how to appreciate the present but also gave us a look at what power-lacing shoes would look like, party thanks to Nike. Providing a non-powered replica; the first Air Mag in 2011 for charity, Nike filled a US Patent on the 8  of July 2014 to create the actual thing and now we have it or at least Michael J. Fox does. If you’re not sure what this whole thing is about or have little to no knowledge of Sci-fi pop-culture, yesterday, the 21  of October 2015, was the date that Doc and Marty travelled to in the movie  . And while the sneakers did make an appearance during the movie back in 1989, they weren’t the real deal; as the prop makers ran some wiring through the lead actor’s pants enabling the laces to tighten themselves. Looking exactly the same on the outside, the latest Nike Air Mags now have a powered mechanism somewhere in its bottom sole that tightens the laces for you once you’ve secured your feet inside and for us normal people, there’s a manual option if the batteries run out of juice.   Similar to the 2011 version of the sneakers, the 2016 consumer release will be produced in limited quantities through open bidding and again all proceeds will be channelled to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. With this innovation Nike hinted at the possibility that one day these power laces could make their way on other sneakers from the brand. “creating something for fiction and turning it into fact” to quote the manufacturer’s CEO, Mark Parker. Here’s a short animated parody of the movie scene when they time-travel to the future. In the crazy scenario that you have, let’s say 5 figures of spare change lying around, feel free to bid during the auction and show off your Nike Air Mags II; we’ll just take the nostalgic route and go on a BTTF marathon.

The confirmed spec sheet has listed that the device carries an OLED QHD (2560 x 1440) 5.4-inch dual-edged screen and the brain of the whole package is a Hexa-core Snapdragon 808 with an Adreno 418 handling graphics.

At RM   2,966 (converted from USD), this could be one of the most expensive consumer Android devices out there – even surpassing the launch price of the BlackBerry Passport in Malaysia (RM 2,399).

Associated mainly with affordability and decent specs, they’ve steadily moved towards manufacturing premium handsets – seen on the   and  . Ahead of the official launch scheduled next week, Lowyat.NET has gotten an insight at how much and which model we’ll be getting. So what makes the   worth RM 2,698 (w/ GST)? The Mate S was marketed during its launch to feature   on its 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) display, but sadly we aren’t getting that model locally (yet?). So what gives? Why the premium price tag that could almost have anyone easily pick up TWO 16GB  s? More so when it looks almost identical despite some contrasting characteristics. Under all that premium metal sits a Kirin 935 Octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM and if those words ring a bell, you’re right if you said that it’s the exact same combo found on the honor 7. The full line includes a 32GB and 128GB version but here we’ll get the gap between, a 64GB model that supports a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE/microSD slot up to 128GB. Flipping the phone over, you’ll see a 13-megapixel RGBW rear camera with OIS and a dual-LED flash module. Move over on to the front and there will be an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor greeting you for all your selfie needs. Unique to only the P8 previously, Knuckle Sense makes a return, now updated to a 2.0 version. A feature that is able to tell the difference between your finger tips and your knuckles; handing you extra gestures by double-tapping or drawing letters to give access to app functionality. Juicing its engine is a 2,700 mAh battery that has quick charge on board. The Mate S also has a fingerprint scanner under the rear camera module if you prefer biometric security to the usual PIN/password settings. All packaged in an overall weight of 156g that runs Huawei’s own EMUI 3.1 skin over Android 5.1 Lollipop. The device will be available in two colour options – Prestige Gold and Coral Pink To be fair to Huawei, Apple’s crème de la crème   has also seen a huge price difference that increases every model, so maybe you can’t put all the blame on the Chinese smartphone maker. Maybe its just the fact that once a brand is recognised for something, it’s hard to shake off and Huawei has always been relatively affordable. Moving with the times isn’t a bad thing but they’ve thrown in some extras to get you on the Mate S team. The list below details what you’ll get together with your new phone: If you jump onboard before the 3,000 mark, they’ll even hand you a bespoke Pewter Membership Card from Royal Selangor; allowing you to be worry free and skip any line at any Huawei Exclusive Service Centres. Too busy to head over? You can also arrange for a delivery and pick-up option for your device’s servicing. Those who want to join the party earlier, or first 1,000 to be precise, will get a complimentary Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) earphones by Huawei. Rounding up, the brand has added some great perks if you purchase the device early but is that enough to convince you? The Huawei Mate S at RM 2,698 makes the   a value-buy or does it?

It’ll be a nice change to see HTC change their inclination to focus more on their “truly meaningful” experiences on Sense – BlinkFeed, Zoe, and themes. Engineers will spend less time tinkering with menus and icons and instead be involved in ensuring that Google’s Android updates are pushed out earlier than its competitors. Soon you’ll probably say goodbye to that repetitive email app that they put on their devices, everyone is hopeful that HTC’s mission to make phones less frustrating actually comes to life. Not specific to just HTC, users who own OEM smartphones tend to be flustered by the same problem, since they know that the manufacturers will take longer than other makers to get an update out. We’ve already seen some improvement from HTC, with their promise to deliver “every” Google software update within 15 days of the Nexus line, at least on the  . U-turning on the Head of Americas  , who said it was an “unrealistic” for any smartphone maker to commit to.   Obviously contextual, we’re not sure how vague “every” means and as pointed out by GSM Arena, there’s bound to be a cut-off moment for support, as always.

While usage of smartphones are usually for texting and social media, navigation would be the second thing that comes to mind. So what about driving? Your eyes are supposed to be peeled on the road, but we all still want access to our GPS and speedometer. Here’s when HUDWAY Glass, a universal vehicle accessory comes into the picture. Car mounts for smartphones save half the trouble but you’ll still be driving blind every time you make a glance at your navigation screen. Some luxury cars readily include these digitals augmented reality displays but the cars themselves, cost a bomb. HUDWAY on the other hand, costs only US$ 49 (RM 211). To date, their Kickstarter has managed to collect US$ 230,000 pledges, exceeding their goal of US$ 100k and they still have 17 days of funding to go. In a convenient easy to use package, the accessory comes in 3 parts: In the first place, ideally we’d prefer if you’d stay away from your smartphones while driving but the accessory would be a great deterrent to the whole situation. Placing your phone on the cradle, and usage of the HUDWAY app (iOS & Android), will enable you to see whats on your screen, merely flipped to mirror that actual image on the special reflective display. Currently, the makers have used the iPhone 6 Plus, as a benchmark for the size of phones, so anything bigger than that might have an issue fitting – bigger than 158 x 77mm, length and width respectively. The team plans to add these functionalities to the HUD display if they manage to hit their stretch goals: In Malaysia, our always sunny days might impair the clarity of the display (or rather your phone’s display reflected). So driving during the daytime while having the HUDWAY on your dashboard, you might not see everything clearly, but larger objects shouldn’t be an issue. Another problematic issue would be your phone overheating due to direct sunlight from being on the dashboard; they’ve put out frankly that this might be a problem and their accessory is passive, so there won’t be any temperature sensors or cooling elements. Let us know what you think of the HUDWAY dashboard car accessory, is it worth it?"

Problem is, most of the time it capture moments of you lowering your iPhone which is natural for anyone to do when taking a normal picture.  This minor annoyance has been fixed with the new iOS 9.1 which is rolling out now to current iOS 9 devices. From the changelog, the updated Live Photos should intelligently detect when the iPhone is being lifted or lowered, so it knows when to start/stop recording at the right time. It also brings a fresh batch of 150 Emojis for all your social and messaging needs.  The iOS 9.1 update weighs about 313MB and you can download it over the air (OTA) via Settings > General > Software Update. It is recommended that you do this over WiFi to save on mobile data.  Apart from the Live Photos fix and additional Emojis, the update also improves a couple of bug fixes that cover Music, Photos, Safari, Search, Calendar, Contacts and Mail.

Here’s what to expect,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/20/samsung-galaxy-s7-might-launch-in-january-2016-heres-what-to-expect/,"3D Touch,Android,force touch,Project Lucky,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 Launch,Samsung Galaxy S7 Rumours,USB Type C","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-10-20,"With the   and   out of the way, Samsung is undoubtedly working full force on next year’s flagship, the Galaxy S7. At the moment, Samsung is leading the Android pack, with benchmark crushing performance and finally a premium build utilising metal and glass materials. So what will Samsung do next for the first half of 2016? Based on what we’ve heard so far, they are introducing a couple of new features to widen its gap against its competitors.  For starters, the Galaxy S7 is expected to use USB Type C, a reversible cable connector that’s supposedly a future standard. Not only it allows faster rapid charge, it also provides faster data transfers even when compared to USB 3.0. New flagships like the OnePlus 2, Lumia 950/950XL and Nexus 5X/6P have already adopted this connector standard and we should be seeing more of these in 2016.  The   has it and so does the latest  . It was recently revealed that Samsung has patented a   that’s similar to 3D Touch. This allows it to differentiate the amount of force being applied onto the screen, based on corresponding voltage.  From the illustrations above, the feature allows multi purpose input such as alternating between space/tab and apply upper case when a key is pressed with extra force. It is possible that Samsung might introduce this on their future flagships, and it may or may not be the Galaxy S7.  The Exynos 7420 processor on the Galaxy S6/Note5 is a proven workhorse, churning out insane benchmark figures yet maintaining frugal battery consumption. For next year, Samsung is rumoured to release the Galaxy S7 with up to   variants.  The Exynos 7422 which was earlier rumoured for the Galaxy Note5 will is expected to power India based units while a newer Exynos 8890 (also known as the Exynos M1) will find its way to Korea, Japan and European markets. Given a pass for Samsung’s 2015 flagships, Qualcomm appears to be making a come back with a Snapdragon 820 processor. The Snapdragon 820 variant is said to be fitted for China and US bound units. So far there’s no mention of what we’re getting in the South East Asian region.  For imaging, the 16MP shooter on the Galaxy Note5/S6 remains unchanged since the Galaxy Note 4. To bring its photography capabilities to the next level, Samsung could be upgrading to a higher 20MP camera that utilises Samsung’s own ISOCELL sensor. Word also has it that it could carry a dual-camera set up, similar to the HTC One M9+. With the Apple iPhone 6s/6s Plus being announced in September, Samsung had brought forward its Galaxy Note5 launch to August, ahead of its traditional September IFA launch. This gave Samsung an early head start to build up its sales momentum before the iDevices go to market.  For 2016, it appears that Samsung might announce the Galaxy S7 as early as January instead of its usual February/March timeline in conjunction with Mobile World Congress. Similar to its current Galaxy S6, there would be two models – SM-G930 and SM-G935 which carry a standard and a dual-curved display. January is just 3 months away. So if you’re planning to get a new flagship smart phone, would you just grab the Galaxy Note5 or wait for the next big thing?"

In terms of specs, the front gets a 5″ Full HD AMOLED display that’s toughen with Gorilla Glass 4. The front looks cleaner and disappointingly it lacks HTC’s trademark BoomSound front stereo speakers that we liked a lot. Instead it opts for a single down firing speaker that’s similar to the iPhone 6s/Galaxy S6. Under the hood, it runs on Qualcomm’s newer 64-bit Octa-Core Snapdragon 617 processor, with a choice of either 2GB RAM with 16GB storage, or a higher-spec 3GB RAM and 32GB storage version.

This delivers 24-bit/192KHz Hi-Res Audio with Dolby Audio™ Surround technology for better enjoyment with some quality headphones plugged-in. On top of that, the One A9 runs on the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box and HTC pledges to update the software within 15 days after the Nexus lineup gets them.  In typical HTC fashion, it gets a smaller than average battery at 2,150mAh that supports Quick Charge 2.0. On the spec sheet, it mentions that   will be compatible once it is available officially. Overall it weighs 143 grams and has a thickness of 7.26mm. That’s the same weight as the iPhone 6s but the iPhone is thinner at 7.1mm. The HTC One A9 will be available globally beginning 1st week of November and it is expected to be priced at US$400, which is about RM1,718 with our current exchange rates. Overall, this isn’t a flagship to challenge the likes of the Galaxy S6 or the Xperia Z5.

Obviously having the company’s optics guy talk to you about how the camera performs isn’t exactly the best way to deliver a product without some favouritism but let’s see the photos first. While the post was fairly in-depth, it probably explored the parts where the Lumia shined – 5 photos in different lighting situations and highlighting different aspects of the phones cameras’ features. Listing out the bare specs of the cameras; Going off a limb by saying that the cameras has the same dynamic range as an SLR and “HDR is rarely needed”. Alakarhu adds on another paragraph how the Lumias are unmatched in low-light shots and how much of the difference the 5  gen OIS and large aperture makes in the images. In the low-light shot, two photos are compared, one from a competitor looking extremely grainy/noisy and the other looking much better. He then talks explains the Rich Capture mode, a feature that takes two exposure moments for the same image – taking in the short for any movements and the long for whatever is stationary. If it works as promised, it’ll allow you to tweak the amount of light in a shot, whilst using flash too. For flashes it’ll take one with and one without, while the three tone flash will appropriately balance out the colour balance to produce a more real life characteristics. It’ll be hard to say if there was any post-production touch-ups done on these images, though for the third photograph, Alakarhu does state that an external reflector and lighting were used for this image. Windows 10 will be on these devices, and they’ll have Continuum compatibility once hooked up to the Display Dock, shown  . Time will tell if Windows Phones can resurrect the name of (Nokia) Lumias.

A worthy companion for anyone that might need to rid their devices of incriminating data in a jiffy. Created by the researcher known as “Dark Purple”, this USB stick comes in the form of a regular USB thumb drive but in no way does it store bytes. This cyber weapon sends 220 volts through its USB interface to your plugged device shorting your whole circuit before you can say “destroyed.” The interface of the USB Killer can be switched to act as a malware stick but that removes the spy element from it, self-destructing would have more appeal for sure. Info from a blog post by the man himself, claimed that his creation could permanently impair “almost any equipment” as long as it had a USB slot – crippling newer TVs, routers, modems and the works. Little to no details have cropped up except for the aforementioned amount of voltage it sends through the USB circuit, or discharges the capacitor quickly. Fresh news crops up after its initial time of fame in March but there’s now a video showing the device being used on the researchers own laptop. The Russian ends by saying that although it seems like the laptop he was using is now “dead” it’ll be brought back to life once a simple motherboard switch is made. So the likeliness of the hard drive being affected is slim at best; why bother then if it only disables the motherboard and not wiping data in the process? Nonetheless, it’ll still keep users cautious not to simply plug in random USB thumb drives lying around."

The flagship of the Moto line, is why we’re here today and by chance that you haven’t heard of its specifications, the Moto X Style/Pure is the largest at 5.7-inches. Its screen is a QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution IPS display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top. Under the hood, you’ll get a 1.8GHz Hexa-core Snapdragon 808, coupled with 3GB of RAM for all your processing needs. The manufacturer’s decision to stray away from the top of the line Qualcomm chipset would point to not wanting to have the burden of dealing with the heating issues that have plagued other smartphone makers. Although it has an option for a MicroSD card (up to 128GB), the base model has 16GB on board, while there’s a 32GB and 64GB variant as well; no word on which we’ll be receiving here. It’s sad to see that manufacturers are still not realising that 16GB just doesn’t cut it anymore on smartphones, a trend that has seen Apple stick with the base 16GB for its own  . For your photo-taking needs, it’ll sport a wide-angle 21-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture that’s capable of shooting in 4K resolution. Flip over to the front, you’ll see a 5-megapixel shutter with its own flash module. A worthy mention when considering its camera optics, which earned it a top 4 (based on points), sharing the spot with the   – at least by   standards. Connectivity-wise, there’s Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, NFC and 4G LTE Cat6 for speeds up to 300Mbps. Those who want to have dual-SIM functionality might have to give the Style/Pure a pass, since it only supports a single nano SIM. The device is also rated at a certified IP52, meaning it’ll be water repellent. All of its internals will be powered by a 3,000 mAh battery that has Turbo Charging, which claims to get you 10 hours of battery life with just 15 minutes of charging and it’ll run a Motorola enriched version of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. As a rough indication, the device retails for US$ 400 (RM 1,684) – 16GB, US$ 450 (RM 1,895) – 32GB and US$ 500 (RM 2,105) – 64GB in the States.

For taking pictures, it is pretty much the same as the normal R7, with a 13MP f/2.2 main camera with PDAF (Phase Detection AF) and a front facing 8MP f/2.4 shooter. Being a slightly bigger device, it also gets an upgrade with a larger 3,070mAh capacity battery that also supports VOOC Flash Charging.

No manufacturer has managed to resolve this issue by themselves, so it’s best you do your research on how to remove it once you’re infected.

Branding wise, the Unifi logo remains unchanged since its inception but its online presence has been revamped with a store-like design for easier online application.  With calls for faster and cheaper broadband, TM has revised its broadband offering with its new Unifi ADVANCE PLAN which claims to pack the best value in the industry. For starters, the new Unifi home plans come in just 2 options – 30Mbps and 50Mbps. This essentially is the same “new” plans   but with reduced subscription fees. The TM Unifi ADVANCE PLAN with 30Mbps is offered at RM179/month instead of RM199/month, and if you need 50Mbps, it can be yours for RM229/month (before GST). By default, you get HyppTV as standard which comes with HyppTV Aneka or HyppTV Varnam Pack for free. You also get a DECT Phone bundled in but calls are now charged separately at 20 sen/min to all local numbers including mobile. For those needing unlimited calls to fixed lines like its former VIP plans, you can opt for the Voice Pack that costs RM20/month.  In terms of speed, the 30Mbps plan gives you 30Mbps download while uploads are at 5Mbps. For RM50/month extra, you get 50Mbps download with a faster uplink of 10Mbps. So if you’re an existing VIP 10 customer enjoying 10Mbps for both download and upload, your next upgrade should be the ADVANCE PLAN with 50Mbps download and 10Mbps. Essentially you’re getting 5x the download speed while the upload speed remains unchanged.  TM insists that its Unifi packages are competitively priced against its competitors. With Maxis jumping onto the fibre broadband business, it had caused a stir with its cheaper 10Mbps offering from as low as RM128/month. When compared on the same speed of 30Mbps, Unifi appears to pack more value considering it includes HyppTV and you get a fixed line with the option for unlimited calls at RM20/month. For enterprise users, they have a similar offering with its Unifi BIZ ADVANCE PLAN. The base 30Mbps plan with Dynamic IP starts at RM259/month (Normal: RM299/month) and you have the option to upgrade to 50Mbps at RM50/month extra. There’s also Simple Voice Plus Plan for free fixed line calls at RM30/month and there are more add-ons for MS Office, POS systems and surveillance services. Like the Home plans, the 30Mbps offering comes with 5Mbps upload while the 50Mbps option gets 10Mbps upload.  Strangely TM has removed its lower 5Mbps, 10Mbps and 20Mbps Unifi packages of old. While the new Unifi ADVANCE PLANS might offer higher speeds for less, it doesn’t really address the concerns of affordable broadband. When we did a  , it seems that the 30Mbps/50Mbps plans have limited coverage areas and if you’re not covered, it suggests that you take up Streamyx instead. Perhaps they should consider introducing a cheaper 5Mbps option without the extra bells and whistles instead."

Putting yourself in this stressful situation tenfold won’t do any favours for your health, so Google has decided to ease that burden off your shoulders for a bit by adding lane guidance for Malaysian public roads.

It’s not rocket science and anyone who wants to have this on their Android devices can just follow these steps. Step 1 
Ensure that your device is set to allow installations from “unknown sources” 
Head on over to your Settings > Security > turn on “unknown sources” Step 2 
Head on to   and download the APK file

A great feature for all Android users who have multiple smartphones, it gets the nod thanks to Google Drive’s APIs that gives permissions to developers, hence offering the ability to users for this backup option. If you’re not too keen on getting the APK, you’ll have to wait until the official update comes to the Play Store, which quoting Google, will only roll out “soon”.

Alexander Wong,Compared: iPhone 6s Telco Offers in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/14/iphone-6s-malaysia-telco-price-comparison-celcom-digi-maxis-umobile/,"Celcom,Comparison,Contract,DiGi,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Celcom,iPhone 6s Digi,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6s Malaysia Comparison,iPhone 6s malaysia contract,iPhone 6s maxis,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6S Price,iPhone 6s Price Comparison,iPhone 6s U Mobile,Maxis,Postpaid,U Mobile","Celcom,DiGi,iOS,iPhone,Maxis,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2015-10-14,"Another year and another iPhone has finally arrived. The   will be available in Malaysia officially this Friday, 16th October at 12:00AM. If you’re looking to buy one on contract, it is available from all 4 telcos namely Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. This is the fastest iPhone 6s roll out yet for Malaysia and it is also the most extensive in terms of contract options. With U Mobile coming into the picture, they have shaken things up a little with its lower commitment plans and an interesting Microcredit financing option. For Maxis, it still retains the same iValue Plan offering that comes with bundled calls, text and SMS. However for those who make lots of phone calls, they are also making its MaxisONE Plan available as well. Celcom on the other hand has the simplest approach with just 3 FIRST plan options that come with its OPTIMISER feature.  Last but not least is Digi where they are bundling the iPhone 6s with their new SmartPlan that can be have with either more data or more voice and SMS. In terms of contract duration, majority of the plans are on 24 months with exception for Maxis and Digi where they do have 12 months option for selected plans.  So which telco should you go for? We’ve gathered the plans and device pricing from all 4 telcos for your easy reference. Check them out after the break. For consistency, we compared the permanent non-promo bundles from each plan with its pricing without the 6% GST. Do note that the above minimum cost of ownership is just a guide and it is based on the assumption that you don’t incur additional usage on top of what has been included with the plan. On Maxis, they are giving 1GB extra for 6 months on its highest MaxisOne 188 plan. On top of that, they are also giving   of additional 1GB for 4G LTE use only for the MaxisONE Plan as well.  Digi on the other hand is giving 2GB of extra data for 12 months in conjunction with its current  . Following closely behind is Celcom where they are giving 1GB extra of free data for 12 months.  During sign up, most of these telcos would require an upfront payment, which is basically like a deposit that would be used to offset your upcoming bills. For U Mobile, they do offer a waiver for the advance payment but you’ll need to pay the device by credit card and sign up for their auto-debit billing feature.  Before committing to a plan on contract, it is always recommended to pick one that suits your needs. The iPhone 6s is obviously cheaper on the highest plan and you might end up paying more than what you actually need. Apart from the calls, SMS and data offering, there are other things to consider such as network quality, customer service and other value added services including international roaming. For those who can’t afford to pay so much upfront, U Mobile offers the flexibility with Microcredit which you can determine its duration and amount. However do note that this works like a personal loan and there’s an interest of approximately 1.2%. As usual, if you spot any errors in the table above, do let us know in the comments above. Considering the iPhone is more expensive than before, getting one with a telco contract would garner more savings provided that you get the right plan. However for those who prefer to get it outright, an iPhone 6s is   from RM3,199 for the base 16GB model. Below is the full iPhone pricelist in Malaysia right now:"

Now that we’re talked about how the wait for the devices were across all four telcos, let’s talk about what Malaysians could be preferring to do instead. Scalpers get excited at the opportunity to jack prices up, if there’s demand. Are Malaysians choosing to buy from these individuals instead? Or have they decided to head on over to Singapore to get their hands on an SG set? It boils down to if you’re going to be disciplined enough to travel back to our neighbours down south for your warranty, if anything were to happen to your Apple product. For scalpers, its mainly down to luck, or if you purchase from places like Lazada, we’ll hope that they fulfill their end of providing warranty coverage. Then you have those who’d rather wait for the storm to end and get their devices hand-delivered to them while in their comforts of their homes. You’ll get to choose from Maxis, Digi and U Mobile, so quite a wide array to choose from. So you tell us, have you ever been in these types of lines in the past?

Alexander Wong,U Mobile offers more data and financial flexibility to own the iPhone 6s in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/10/u-mobile-offers-more-data-and-financial-flexibility-to-own-the-iphone-6s-in-malaysia/,"Flexi U MicroCredit,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Plus Malaysia,iPhone 6s U Mobile,U Microcredit,U Mobile,U Mobile iPhone 6s,U Mobile Micro Credit","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2015-10-10,"The big 3 telcos – Celcom, Digi and Maxis have revealed their iPhone 6s plans. If you take a glance at all 3, they are the same old postpaid contract approach where you fork out a hefty sum for both device and advance payment. For U Mobile, they are offering   but it gets more generous quotas and greater flexibility to make owning an iPhone 6s easier.  Could this be the best iPhone 6s deal in town? Read on to find out. For starters, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are offered with their iPlans, offering Voice, SMS and data all-in in either postpaid or prepaid. The lowest option is their i40 plan that comes with 1.5GB of data, 40 minutes of calls and 20 SMS to all networks for just RM40/month. If you commit RM20/month extra on i60, you’ll get 5GB of data, 60 minutes of calls and 30 SMS. For any excess usage, all calls are charged at 5 sen/30 seconds and 3 sen/SMS to all networks For the hardcore users, the higher i90 (RM90/month) and i130 (RM130/month) plans both offer unlimited phone calls and they come with 7GB and 10GB of data respectively. This is probably the closest plan to their recent   offering. Overall, U Mobile appears to be the most generous with data among the 4 participating telcos.  If you have an existing device, you can   hassle free with U Mobile and they are accepting as high as RM1,900 for an iPhone 6 Plus. On top of that, all trade-ups to an iPhone 6s will enjoy extra savings with an additional RM100 rebate.   In terms of device, the subsidised iPhone 6s pricing on U Mobile are as follows (inclusive 6% GST): During sign up, there’s an advance payment which is rebated back across 24 months. However this can be waived if you pay the device by credit card and sign up for auto debit billing facility. There’s also a   with participating credit cards.  Another neat reason to sign up with U Mobile is its Contract Freedom promise. You may leave their network at anytime without penalty. However you’ll either lose the remaining rebates if you’ve paid advance payment and for those who didn’t, will need to pay back the pro-rated subsidy of the device.   Previously U Mobile had introduced its very own MicroCredit facility which is basically a special financing for the device. This time they are offering the extra flexibility of the amount (RM1,000-RM3,500) as well as repayment duration (12, 24, 30 and 36 months) according to your preference. With MicroCredit, there’s no deposit or credit card required but take note that they will charge you with an interest rate of 1.2%."

The three devices are slated to make an official appearance in Malaysia on the 29  October during this special invite-only event (you can sign up  ).

Also, all three will make use of Sony’s latest 23-megapixel sensor that won it the best smartphone camera by  , hopefully giving the other camera-ready flagships a run for their money in real-life situations. Sony smartphone camera sensors have always been top class, as seen on other notable flagships but the Japanese company seems to lag behind in the image processing department. The smallest of the Xperia bunch, the Z5 Compact will only command 4.6-inches of screen-estate in the form of a 720p (1280 x 720) resolution. While its internals utilise the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor found on its bigger brothers, it only has 2GB of RAM. For your storage there’s 32GB internally but you’ll get a microSD slot to expand up to 200GB if you want to. As mentioned earlier, it’ll come equipped with the same camera sensors as its bigger siblings; 23-megapixels on the rear and 5-megapixels on the front. As the smallest of the three, it shows itself in four playful colours; Graphite Black, White, Yellow and Coral. The middle-child, the Xperia Z5 sports a larger and denser 5.2-inch FHD display (1920 x 1080). Similarly, it’ll have the 810 SoC, 32GB of internal storage and feature the same camera setup but come with 3GB of RAM and a 2,900 mAh battery instead. Saving the best for last, the Xperia Z5 Premium will include the first-ever 4K (2840 x 2160) 5.5-inch screen – if you did the math, that’s about 806 ppi. A screen of such caliber has to have a camera capable of matching the output, so the aforementioned 23-megapixel 1 / 2.3-inch Exmor RS Sensor with a f/2.0 lens is capable of shooting 4K. : Sony Malaysia will be launching the Xperia Z5 Compact Dual, Xperia Z5 Dual and Xperia Z5 Premium Dual.  Other than its larger 3,430 mAh capacity battery, there’s not much that sets it apart from the Xperia Z5. All three support LTE networks and could arrive in a dual-SIM variant on our shores but if you’re relying on SIRIM, the Compact model listed only shows the singular SIM. However, the two larger devices aren’t shown, so maybe they might be dual-SIM capable. If you’d like to find out more about the Xperia Z5 Compact and Z5 click  , for the Z5 Premium make your way  ."

Sharing his thoughts on the holiday-season ready OnePlus X during an interview with USA Today, Pei said that it was tough choosing between the OnePlus 2 and this new device.

It also adds to SIRIM’s details that it’ll have LTE on board and the photos imply that it’ll use a USB Type-C connector. Rumoured reports have gone to state that it’ll retail for only   (RM 1,035) and have a MediaTek Helio X10 processor under the hood, along with 2GB of LD-DDR3 RAM for performance related-task. Considered a mid-ranger of sorts, it’ll apparently sport a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display and feature 32GB of internal storage that is expandable through a microSD card. It’s purported to house at least 3,000 mAh of battery and have NFC capabilities. Otherwise, its camera is rumoured to be a 13-megapixel f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor that can get you up to 4K video recording and a 5-megapixel shutter rounds off the front. Has OnePlus run out of ideas?

Arif Lee,Another OnePlus device is heading for Malaysia. Is this the OnePlus X?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/09/oneplus-x-e1003-malaysia-certification/,"Android,Dual Sim,OnePlus,OnePlus E1003,OnePlus E1003 malaysia,OnePlus mini,OnePlus mini Malaysia,OnePlus X,OnePlus X Malaysia,SIRIM","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus",2015-10-09,"Taking some heat away from OnePlus’ inability to supply enough of their  , a new device has been spotted on the SIRIM database as E1003. This comes 2 months after Carl Pei was quoted on   that he had a hard time choosing between the (possible)   and the OnePlus 2. OnePlus’ newest smartphone is apparently its take on a more aesthetically pleasing product, not its usual “Flagship Killer” motive. What we can confirm so far is that the new One E1003 will only support Wi-Fi bands from a/g/n omitting the best “ac” support out. At least it’ll support Dual-SIM LTE based on the certification listing, bringing some hope for the device. A previous report states that the OnePlus X/mini would launch sometime during the holiday season, echoing the   of its co-founder and will retail for only   (RM 1,035). While its price might draw conclusions that it’ll less than worthy spec device, it surprises by supposedly running a MediaTek Helio X10 processor, coupled with 2GB of LP-DDR3 RAM. Its screen is reported to be a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display and the storage appears to be 32GB internally, and it’ll have a microSD slot – a first for the OnePlus lineup. Tuned up with a polished 2.5D Gorilla Glass the edges will taper smoothly, hoping translating to better ergonomics. Somewhere under the hood, its purported that there will be at least 3,000/3,100 mAh powering the new smartphone. Straying a bit from the OnePlus 2, the Mini is claimed anonymously to carry NFC, an IR Blaster, front facing 1.2W loud speaker and the familiar USB Type-C that supports fast charge. Camera-wise it allegedly showcases a 13-megapixel f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor, supporting video up until 4K if you’re into the whole pixel game. The front on the other hand, gets a 5-megapixel shutter. There also has been rumours that it’ll be IP67 dust and waterproof, yet it’ll still maintain the removable back with customisable finishes and textures. Do you think   has delivered enough OnePlus 2’s to be able to handle the ramped-up demand of this mid-ranger?

Well apparently if you can connect every 1 in 2 Malaysians, it’ll earn you the title. Digi has managed to surpass their 45% network coverage year-end target by 5% and their network is currently able to support that 50% of the population on their high-speed internet service. It doesn’t just stop there, as they plan to further their rollout by an additional 1,500 cell tower sites by the end of 2015 to increase their already wide network. Words from Digi’s CEO, Albern Murty says that Digi has expanded their “4G LTE coverage to reach 28 major cities and secondary towns nationwide.” Their 4G networks are now able to support the 1800MHz and 2600MHz base bands. Obviously more spectrum bands allow wider coverage and it’ll help both indoors and outdoors too. So far in the past 3 years, the yellow themed telco company has spent RM 2.3 billion in CAPEX (capital expenditures), with the funds mainly going to its networks. Additionally, they’ve set aside another RM 900 million for this year to increase their network strength for Malaysians."
Alexander Wong,TM drops more clues for its 15th October reveal,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/13/tm-drops-more-clues-for-its-15th-october-reveal/,"Broadband,High Speed Broadband,HSBB,Telekom Malaysia,TM,TM Unifi,Unifi","Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2015-10-13,"Earlier on TM has teased us that   on 15th of October. As we are just 2 days to go, TM has released its   which gives us a tiny bit more clues on what to expect on the actual day.  Again toying with the notion of launching a smart phone, the new site reads “A breakthrough device enhanced with Unifi” with the claim of providing the best broadband experience for your device. Scrolling further down, the page emphasises on 3 things – unlimited experience, unmatched choices and unbeatable value. In terms of current Unifi broadband, we are still getting unlimited quotas and this is expected to remain unchanged for the time being. As for choices, we’ve seen TM introducing more HyppTV channels and   that offer faster download speeds for less. Is TM going to respond to the competition with even faster speeds and affordable subscription? We really hope to see that this coming Thursday.  What’s interesting is the area of Mobility as shown above. TM has the spectrum to operate a 4G LTE telco but we feel it is too soon for them to go live at this point of time. Furthermore, the site has been consistently talking about broadband rather than a mobile network. Perhaps it is an extended internet services from its TMgo 4G LTE broadband or its newly acquired P1 subsidiary that runs on WiMAX.  At the bottom of the page, TM invites you to register your interest on whatever they are going to launch and you’ll stand a chance to win a smart phone. No smart phone models were mentioned but since TM is announcing this closely to the iPhone 6s, they better be giving that away after all that teasing.

Arif Lee,Half of iPhone 6s’ produced may have lower performance and there’s nothing you can do about it,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/09/half-of-iphone-6s-produced-may-have-lower-performance-and-theres-nothing-you-can-do-about-it/,"apple,iOS,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Battery Life,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Processor,iPhone 6s variants,iPhone 6s versions,Samsung,TSMC","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-09,"A manufacturer with high standards such as Apple would be assumed to be a company that it takes a lot to please but do 2% – 3% of a gap make a difference? Well it surely does, if you look at the actual numbers. Immensely so, if you needed that extra battery mile to last through your long work day or on your expedition in some desolated area. Apple says the difference is negligible on the   and the   but we’ll let you decide yourself. Basically, Apple’s iDevices vary in their processors by engaging two different vendors to supply their A9 chipset. On one hand, you have (their competitor) Samsung, while the other 50% is made by TSMC. The former has a 14nm FinFET process footprint, opposed to the latter – 16.nm FinFET process. This allegiance is nothing new, as Apple has enlisted help for quite a number of years already. In real-world scenarios the 2-3% could set off alarms, depending how you use your new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. A Geekbench battery test was run comparing the two devices and the results are shown below: Other than their battery scores, the two processors also performed differently on AnTuTu’s benchmark – TSMC’s chip won overall. In the same test, it was also clear that their batteries levels differed; again, the TSMC processor had more battery left (77%), when compared to the Samsung powered iPhone 6s (71%). If you managed to do the math, that’s a 6% disparity in numbers, which is double the 3% Apple noticed in their lab tests. Then again, once you’ve loaded up your apps and info, your device would run totally different compared to someone with the same chipset. So its possible that Apple was spot on with the 2-3% irregularity. Being quick to assess damage Apple has since made a statement addressed to the various publications that brought this information to light. There’s nothing much you can do about it though, but if you’d like to see if you’ve one-upped a friend/family member of yours, by all means use this iTunes approved   to identify if your iPhone 6s / Plus is using the better performing chip If your device list these magic model numbers below then you’re in luck: 
iPhone 6s – N71MAP / iPhone 6s Plus – N66MAP but if you’re finding this model number instead, you’re on the other end: 
iPhone 6s – N71AP / iPhone 6s Plus – N66AP There may be a silver lining after all, cause any company should have an amazing reason choosing two sources for their internals. As far as supply and demand go, it’s tough when you need to go to a competitor like Samsung to get your chipsets, and relying on them is definitely pain. You could say that, biting the bullet and producing real-world results through its products on the shelves allows Apple to gauge if there’s still worth in getting chips from Samsung. Can Malaysians nationwide do anything about this? Well it’ll be hard to make a case stating that their device is inferior, cause there’s no way of telling the difference when actually buying the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus; unlike Android OEMs (e.g Samsung) that clearly tell you that this model is an Exynos processor, while the other is a Qualcomm chip. Apple’s statement was only directed at one publication but it doesn’t take a lot to assume that they will continue to roll-out system updates that could make them more alike; whether that means making the Samsung chip in the iPhone 6s / Plus better than the TSMC’s or vice versa, still remains unseen. Their power in controlling both their hardware and software internally gives them the ability to tweak and adjust to these issues highlighted. What do you make of this? Will Apple’s new iPhones suffer? Or will people just live with their new status symbol? Let us know your thoughts in the comment below."

As seen earlier, the full pricing is similar to Digi with the iPhone 6s priced from RM3,199 for the 16GB model while the iPhone 6s Plus going from RM3,699 for the same capacity. Below is the full pricelist for the entire range available right now: While it is listed on the  , it isn’t available for orders just yet. Our guess is to try checking them out next week closer to launch but you would probably need a wait a bit longer for delivery. So RM3,199 for a 16GB iPhone 6s, is this the flagship worth paying for? For long term practicality especially if you take photos and videos a lot, which we think you would, we strongly recommend that you go for at least 64GB.   Alternatively you could consider taking one up subsidised on contract with a plan that suits your needs. Both   and   have revealed their plans and you can pre-order with them now.

A year and a half later the CEO of Sony, Kazuo Hirai spoke to reporters saying that there has been constant restructuring in the smartphone department but if they fail to bring home the milk or at least self-sustain next year, they might have to scrap it all together. Change doesn’t immediately equate to results but it points in the right direction, if you’ve been paying attention to the recently released   line, it’s a glimmer of hope that could turnaround Sony’s profits. A lesson from its   that received a lot of negativity, due to the bad choice of processor – the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 (at the time the heat issues weren’t mediated properly).   a look at how the Z5 Premium handles its heating. Sony’s lineup has looked awfully familiar for quite a number of generations; begging the question, if they’ll do away with their OmniBalance design. Rumours say that they might just do so in 2016 – chances are it’ll coincide with the new   for Android that Sony has been testing in Sweden.   Even with the aforementioned measures taken to decrease losses could not save Sony from expectedly posting a 60 billion yen / US$ 480 million (RM 1.97 billion) lost for this year. Exceeding the indicative figure of 39 billion yen / US$ 310 million (RM 1.27 billion) that was predicted. Not a great outlook for the Japanese company that ships only 1% of the smartphones in the States, while just captivating 17.5% of its own domestic market.

Tougher and thicker, thanks to the 7000D series aluminium that added 0.1-0.2mm to its overall footprint.

The big brother in the form of the 6s Plus does have an upper hand in the camera department, as Apple has added Optical Image Stabilisation. On the front however, the old 1.2-megapixel sensor is replaced by a 5-megapixel shutter with f/2.2 aperture and adding the new Retina Flash to brighten up your selfies.

Once enabled, you can set to backup automatically by daily, weekly or monthly. You also get to choose not to include those bulky videos to your backup. The cloud backup feature has been long anticipated for Android users, and it was   for a short while in April before WhatsApp pulled the plug. For iOS, iPhone users are already able to backup their chats automatically and they are stored on Apple’s iCloud service. At time of writing, the latest version on the Google Play Store still doesn’t have the Google Drive option yet. According to Google, the feature will be rolling out in the coming months, so it looks like we’ve got to wait for a while before it reaches here."
Alexander Wong,Surface Pro 4: The Tablet that could put Most Laptops to shame,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/07/surface-pro-4-the-tablet-that-could-put-most-laptops-to-shame/,"Laptop,microsoft,Microsoft Surface,Microsoft Surface Pro,Microsoft Surface Pro 4,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Malaysia,Microsoft Windows 10,New Surface pen,Surface,Surface Pro 4 Type Cover,Tablet,Windows 10","Microsoft,Mobile Devices",2015-10-07,"The tablet is normally seen as a media consumption device and nobody has done productivity better than Microsoft’s Surface Pro series. The new Surface Pro 4 marks its 4th generation of its 2-in-1 tablet/laptop convergence device and it runs on the very latest Windows 10.  The current Surface Pro 3 to us is a breakthrough as it offers a full Windows experience in a true tablet form. It did live up to its “Tablet that could replace your Laptop” claim and the new one just raises the bar to a whole new level.  Size does matter and we’ve seen countless of 2-in-1 devices that are just too heavy for tablet use. The Surface Pro 4 now gets a larger 12.3″ display that does a higher 2736×1824 pixels resolution while maintaining the same footprint of 292.1mm x 201.42mm. As comparison, the Surface Pro 3 has a 12″ screen that pushes 2160×1440 pixels resolution. On top of that, Microsoft has made it even thinner at 8.45mm (Surface Pro 3: 9.1mm) and lighter from 766 grams (Surface Pro 3: 800g).  The front still gets a pair of stereo speakers and microphones while the top gets a 5MP front camera. Over at the rear, the camera gets bumped up to 8MP and it comes with auto focus. You still get a full sized USB 3.0, microSD card reader, headphone jack and a Mini DisplayPort, all encased in its Magnesium body that comes in Silver.  In the current Surface Pro 3, Microsoft had introduced a variety of Intel Core processors with various memory and storage options to suit every need. For the Surface Pro 4, the list is even more extensive with the latest 6th generation Intel Core processors. At the base level, they have opt for an Intel Core m3 processor instead of the usual i3 with a minimum of 4GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage. For those who demand more power and have a loads of cash to burn, you can opt for the highest Core i7 processor with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.  Performance wise, the Surface Pro 4 is reported to be 30% faster than the Surface Pro 3 and 50% faster than the competing MacBook Air. No doubt it drives the price up to exorbitant levels and this is made worse with our current exchange rate. The full pricing for the Surface Pro 4 are as follows: Moving on to what makes the Surface Pro 4 a laptop replacement is the keyboard. The new Surface Pro 4 Type Cover has been massively improved to provide a better laptop class experience and it is thinner than before. The keys have been redesigned with larger spacing in between like a laptop chiclet keyboard which is made quieter and comfortable to type on. The trackpad meanwhile is 40% larger and it comes with a glass surface that tracks 5 multi-touch points. If you’re using a Surface Pro 3, good news for you as the new keyboard is compatible as well. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover is priced at US$129.99 which is about RM554. With more players getting their hands onto styluses, Microsoft had introduced a newer Surface Pen. It boasts 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity (current Surface Pen: 256 levels) and it even comes with an eraser at the back. This replaces the secondary button on the sides, leaving just one for right clicking, while the eraser tip still doubles as a Magic Button which launches OneNote on a single click.  For the right feel and shade, there are interchangeable Pen Tips where you can swap from 2H, H, HB and B tips. It still connects via Bluetooth and with a AAAA battery, the new Surface Pen still lasts a whole year without charging needed in between. For storage, the Surface Pen now clips onto the slides of the Surface Pro 4 with the help of magnets. It sounds like a good solution but we’re not sure if it could hold on well with clumsy hands.   Overall, the Surface Pro 4 is thinner, lighter, faster and massively improved to steer you away from the traditional laptop. For those who work on the lap a lot, we are still unconvinced with the practicality of the kick stand but it is perfect when it’s used on the table. With the price tag of US$999 for the minimum Core i5 model, it is quite expensive compared to other similarly equipped laptops. If budget permits, this is still the best 2in1 hybrid tablet/laptop out there and it is more practical than Apple’s  . It will be available at selected markets on 26th October with pre-orders available starting today. For more info, head over to the   page."

They drew oooohs and ahhhhs during their presentation that starred the Surface Pro 4, the Surface Book, the HoloLens and the smallest of the bunch, the Microsoft Band 2. Microsoft wants you to destroy limits with their new wearable, stated for individuals who want to be in a better state of health and just get more things done. Microsoft’s first band was packed with features but failed to be something people would want on their wrist, partly cause of its design; often compared to be clunky and simply too cumbersome to be a daily wearable. Consumers should now be happier, cause Microsoft listened and their engineers in Redmond took more time to design the Band 2 to be more ergonomic. A word that you’d first expect to hear when wearables are concerned. Now curvier than ever, its Gorilla glass display tears at an angle! Yes, we all love curves. Some (beneficial) elements do return; in the form of the AMOLED display (320 x 128), 2 day battery life, GPS and an optical heart sensor. The device can thank the battery’s change of placement for being less bulky, now at one end of the smart watches’ straps. On the opposite end of the strap is a metal clasps – nothing too interesting, except it doubles as the charging connector that you snap on to the charging dock magnetically. The 0-80% in 30 minutes fast charging feature makes a return too, making sure you’ll be ready to get to it after charging in just half an hour. Design language aside, the Microsoft Band 2 has some internal upgrades that increase its adaptability for those who love staying active. A barometer now lives somewhere on the watch, along with a native UV sensor that monitors rays constantly. Golfers will surely ravel at the sensors and functionality included; distances measured from the tee to the hole and swing mechanics to help those drives just to name a few. It’ll help you track other stuff too with its 8 other sensors. Tracking sports like running, biking and weights should appeal to the common folk too. Day to day task are easier to handle with your new personal assistant, Cortana, who lives on your device as well. Supported mobile devices are listed below: You’ll be able to get your hands on the Microsoft Band 2 in the States for $249.99 (RM 1,049), $50 more than its predecessor but a worthy price to pay for a hefty upgrade. We’ll let you know if/when it comes our way, locally. Do let us know what you think about Microsoft’s new wearable in the comments below."

To bring the same experience onto smaller screens, they had just announced their latest flagship smart phones – the   and  . The operating system is no longer called Windows Phone but simply Windows 10 in line with its new direction.  The Lumia 950 and 950 XL aren’t just about the latest hardware but a more integrated experience with its family of products. One notable feature is how it transforms the smart phone to deliver a PC-like experience via Windows Continuum. This is better implemented than other smart phone to PC docks we’ve seen before. Going through the specs, there’s no surprises from what we’ve seen in  . Both the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL come with a Quad HD AMOLED ClearBlack display that are 5.2″ and 5.7″ respectively. These are the highest resolution smart phones Microsoft has ever made with over 500ppi in pixel density. The Lumia 950 XL gets Gorilla Glass 4 protection while the Lumia 950 settles for Gorilla Glass 3.  Under the hood, the 950 XL gets Qualcomm’s 2.0GHz Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor while the 950 gets a 1.8GHz Hexa-core Snapdragon 808 unit. Both of which comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of on-board storage. Should you need more especially when shooting 4K videos, there’s a microSD slot which supports 200GB. But in theory, it can go up to 2TB when such capacity is available. Being a flagship, the PureView camera is back with a 20MP f/1.9 1/2.4″ main shooter with a triple-LED RGB flash for natural looking illumination. Like most new high-end devices, it shoots 4K videos in 30fps while audio is is captured with Lumia Rich Recording that uses 4 microphones. For shake free shots, Optical Image Stabilisation comes as standard and you can capture moments quicker with a dedicated camera button. For the front, it gets a 5MP wide angle f/2.4 camera which supports Full HD video recording. Keeping the lights on is a removable 3,000mAh battery for the Lumia 950 and a larger 3,340mAh for the XL sibling. As one of the pioneers of wireless charging on a smart phone, it still supports native Qi Wireless charging for both models. If you decide to juice up the old school way, Microsoft is future-proofing its Lumia 950/950 XL with USB Type C that supports fast charging. During the presentation, they shared that a 50% charge can be accomplished in just 30 minutes. Connectivity wise, both ticked the right boxes with faster 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and 4G LTE. Which ever model you pick, there’s also a dual-SIM variant but it is subject to each respective market. Another new feature is its Windows Hello biometric authentication feature. The actual workings behind it wasn’t explained clearly but the product demo looks similar to Android’s Face Unlock with the use of its front camera. Earlier rumours suggest an Iris recognition technology that’s assisted by IR light. Probably one of the coolest feature is Windows Continuum. With a  , you can simply plug in your USB Type C cable from your phone and it offers a PC-like desktop experience. The dock is a tiny box weighing 230 grams and it comes with 3 USB and HDMI/Display Port. When plugged in, you can check Outlook, edit your MS Office documents like a real machine and the transition is simply seamless. So if you got a spare monitor, keyboard and mouse at home, you can leave your clunky laptop at work but still get things done all from your mobile device. Now that’s the power of a PC in your pocket. The Lumia 950 and 950 XL will be available starting in November and they are priced at $549 (RM2,379) and $649 (RM2,813) respectively.

If you’ve ever wanted a Surface but preferred it to be bigger and a non-flex like typing experience, Microsoft has just machined it for you. At 13.5-inches, the Gorilla Glass PixelSense screen will still give you a touchscreen experience at 3000 x 2000 resolution delivering 267 ppi. The display gives you the ability to tote it around if you just want a “clipboard” or attach it to the keyboard for (Microsoft’s promised) the best typing experience on a laptop. Microsoft bundles the Surface Pen together giving you the tool to create content, be it drawing or writing. The Pen, which has 1,024 levels of touch sensitivity – that’s 4 times more compared to the old Pen, and they added an eraser too on the tail. Yet another way to interact with the screen in one of the most precise methods in a tool that supposedly gives you all-year battery life.. If the Pen doesn’t suit your needs, the keyboard and trackpad should – giving you 1.6mm of key travel and a huge precision touch glass pad for those cursor movements. Intel’s latest 6  Gen Intel (Skylake) processor sits inside this wonderful package. If you need more graphics? Just add on the dedicated graphics card (at a pretty price), which is somewhere under the keyboard. RAM options start from 8GB and go up to 16GB and you’ll have PCIE storage that range from 128GB to 512GB – odd, if you noticed that the Surface Pro 4 went up to 1TB. Being a Windows 10 devices event, its a given that the it runs Windows 10 out of the box. Productivity and exceptional performance, Microsoft’s new toy is expected to handle your designing, video editing and gaming; all in one seamless (not gap-less, eh) package. So much power in a small footprint but how does the battery fare? Microsoft swears by a 12-hour battery life but we’ll wait for the real-world testing first before jumping on the bandwagon. But wait, a laptop? Who could care less, then the video showed that you can detach it from the keyboard. Sharing information now is easier, just detach and pass it down; literally, they passed it around during the presentation. Run programs like Adobe Creative Cloud, AutoCAD, Citrix and anything else on the Book + Keyboard combo, since the discrete card lives in the latter. Their dynamic fulcrum hinge and cable wire lock technology looks promising but we noticed some unnecessary screen wobbling towards the end after angling the screen, hopefully it holds up well over time. Fashioned out of magnesium in a 3.48 pounds (approx. 1.5 kg) package, the dimensions of the device are below: The ports of this detach-able laptop are two USB 3.0 ports, a full-sized SD card reader, a 3.5mm audio jack and a mini DisplayPort. On connectivity you’ll get 802.11ac for Wi-Fi while also supporting a/b/g/n. Being a tablet of-sorts, it has an 8-megapixel rear camera with autofocus, capable of 1080p recording while for audio it has a dual microphone setup (front and rear) and Dolby front-facing stereo speakers. Here are the configuration options that you’ll be able to personalise your Surface Book and how well it stacks up against the Surface Pro 4: There’s no word when the Surface Book will arrive in Malaysia as of yet. A sadder notion is that the exchange rate isn’t favouring the Ringgit at all currently, though we’d like to know if you’d consider Microsoft’s new Surface Pro 4 or the Surface Book.

Jump straight to   to find out which is the best as voted by you New devices,  call for new camera shootout tests and our latest camera blind test will pit the newest   against the  ,   and  . The last smartphone that took home the   as voted by you guys was the LG G4, but will it come to an end today? The newcomer of the group, the iPhone 6s Plus doesn’t pack a high megapixel count – only 12 on its rear iSight camera but its pixels come in at 1.22µ pixels, helping it somewhat. Storage might be an issue for the aforementioned device if you love those Live Photos, since the extra “moving picture” takes up roughly the same amount of space as the photos you take. Distinctive to the “Plus” is OIS (Optical Image Stabilisation), allowing you to take more stable shots when compared to its little brother, while its aperture is listed at f/2.2. For the first time we decided to include the front camera for our shootout and the iPhone 6s/6s Plus has a 5-megapixel sensor up front, with the same aperture as its rear camera. It also has the new Retina Flash, Apple’s alternative to putting an LED flash at the front like some selfie-centric phones in the market. Edging out the competition in the last shootout, does the 16-megapixel (rear) LG G4 camera have what it takes to hit the podium again? Well, the f/1.8 aperture rear camera has some tricks up its sleeves – similarly it has OIS as well but laser autofocus is what sets it apart. In terms of the front sensor, 8-megapixels makes its way on the top half of the display."

Claimed to push the boundaries of interaction with your smartphone, it features a pressure sensitive screen that expands features based on touch and it could even weigh an orange! Following its global announcement, we finally have new details of it making a surprise appearance on   – leading us to believe that the device will soon make its way to Malaysia. The device isn’t a one trick-pony, considering it boasts some decent specs to go along with its “force touch” technology. Housed inside the all metal-chasis, is a home-grown Kirin 935 8-core processor, mated to 3GB of RAM, all in a 5.5-inch package. Its screen is a FHD display (1920 x 1080) and has curves on the back that tee off slightly, while the front makes use of 2.5D Gorrila Glass 4 to smooth the edges. There are two variants of the devices but the model listed on SIRIM is the CRR-UL00 model which comes with dual-SIM and has a different band support. It also supports 4G LTE in either FDD and TDD standards.  But as a rough indication, the UK   site is selling the 32GB version at £469.00, instead of its larger 64GB model. Based on   in the UK, the Mate S in “Standard version” doesn’t come with the pressure sensitive display and it is said to be available later in a high-spec trim with 128GB of storage. So it is still a question mark whether we are getting the “Force Touch” high-spec version in Malaysia. In terms of its imaging, a 13-megapixel camera will support its photo taking on the rear, while the front gets a 8-megapixel shooter. The former is an f/2.0 4-colour RGBW camera sensor with OIS and dual-LED flash. On the latter, its an f/2.4 shooter with an accompanying soft LED light for flash. Fans of gestures will ravel over the (for show) Knuckle sense technology. An upgraded 2.0 version allows you to draw a “C” shape to open the camera app – we’re unsure how many of you will take notice or even use this though. The metal-chasis on the back surrounds a distinctive Huawei shaped fingerprint sensor. From Apple to Samsung, the Mate S also shares the 3 microphone multi way conference recording feature as seen on the Galaxy Note 4. A feather weight of sorts at 156grams and 7.2mm thick, it still manages to pack a 2,700 mAh battery under all that metal. Android 5.1 will run the device’s OS but have a EMUI 3.1 skin to go on top. No official word on its pricing yet in Malaysia, nor has there been news on the release date but we’ll keep you in the loop."

Celcom has introduced its new FIRST Basic 85 Internet Plan which gives you 21GB of mobile data for only RM85/month. Although it sounds the same, this isn’t the same as the standard   that comes with an OPTIMISER feature. Instead, this is a data-centric plan that gives you loads of data while calls are only charged when you need it. For RM85/month, by default it comes with 7GB of mobile data and 7GB of Celcom WiFi (if you could find one) that’s usable anytime of the day. The remaining 14GB of data (plus 14GB of Celcom WiFi) is allocated only for off-peak hours between 2AM and 8AM daily.  According to the  , unused internet can be carried forward with a maximum of 7GB to the following month and this is only from your 24 hour data bucket. Once you’ve finished your internet allocation, speeds will be throttled to 64kbps and there’s a limit of 15GB per billing cycle. If you need more data at full speeds, you can top up from as little as RM3 for 100MB, or you can opt for more at RM15/GB and RM50 for 5GB. As for calls, it isn’t specified clearly but SMS and MMS are charged at 15 sen to all networks. Interestingly if you’ve finished your FIRST Basic 85 Internet allocation, all calls and SMS are charged at 10sen. Come to think of it, this is basically Celcom’s   with voice and you can sign up without the unnecessary activation and registration fee.  Should you get this over the standard Celcom FIRST Basic 85? If you use more than 5GB a month and hardly make any calls, the answer is probably yes. As comparison, the standard FIRST Basic 85   gives you 5GB of internet, 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS for the heavy internet user.

The aforementioned price is just an indication of how much you’ll be dishing out for the 2-in-1 convertible. Below we’ve listed the prices of the OLD Surface Pro 3 (at the time the USD to MYR exchange rate was 3.147) Compare that to their US prices today: We hope that the Ringgit trades higher in the coming month so your devices will be cheaper. Obviously there will still be people buying these devices at their current prices, but one can only hope for the best. Multitasking, productivity and portability are just some of the Surface Pro 4’s main advantages, and powerful enough to be the “Tablet that can replace your laptop”, many have already put their bets on the recently released device. From the well-phrased tweet above, you’ll see that Microsoft’s twitter account officially mentions the release date proving that Malaysia isn’t always the last in receiving devices, with only a 6-week wait beckoning. The same account @marauderz   about the   too but received a lesser informative reply, stating that the bigger device will begin its release in US, Canada and Australia; in that order, followed by a roll-out in other countries (no indicative date set).

Following the whole shamble, both Samsung and Google jumped on to have monthly updates to remedy any such incidents in the future. Further extending on Android 6.0 when Google highlights the ability for the OS to show you when you last downloaded and applied a security update.   Some HTC users took to Twitter to address their anxiety as to why the Taiwanese company had been so silent on the matter; compared to LG and Samsung who made statements immediately. Jason Mackenzie, President of HTC Americas then replied these tweets saying that cellular carriers are setting an “unrealistic” schedule; he then adds that HTC doesn’t want to commit to something and receive backlash for not delivering that same promise. As a follow-up, Mackenzie does say that HTC has been very transparent with their updates, which will only get better – as seen by  , who says that the company updates them frequently on submission of updates to carriers (even pre-approval).

Dubbed as the OnePlus mini, it is said that it would be  aesthetically focused instead of having top notch specs like the  . According to a new source, the OnePlus mini will be launched sometime in November/December with an estimated price tag of US$250, which is about RM1,091 in our current exchange rate. As expected with a “mini” model, it is a notch down with a purported 5″ Full HD IPS display and is powered by MediaTek’s Helio X10 processor mated with 2GB of LP-DDR3 RAM.  On-board storage seems to be decent at 32GB and guess what, it even comes with a microSD slot. For the front, it gets a more polished 2.5D Gorilla Glass which makes it smoother to touch around the edges. Keeping the lights on is a decent 3,000/3,100mAh capacity battery which is non removable.  The rest of the features appear to be an improvement over its “2016 Flagship Killer”. The anonymous source claims that NFC will be present along with an IR Blaster, front facing 1.2W loud speaker and a USB Type-C connector which supports fast charge.  The camera is said to be a 13MP f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor that supports 4K videos while the front gets a standard 5MP shooter with Full HD video capabilities. Like the current OnePlus devices, the back is removable allowing you to customise with a variety of shells and word has it, that it could feature IP67 dust and waterproof capabilities. At this point, these are just speculations and while the specs are no way top notch like the OnePlus 2, the feature list seems to be quite compelling. However for the price tag, it faces cheaper alternatives like the Redmi Note 2 that’s priced at 999 CNY (about RM684).

Knowing that this is a roll-out, you can expect the OTA’s to eventually come in but be ready to wait up to a month or so, until the actual notification update comes in. Expect new apps and features to now live on your device – notably, an extensive search function; Now on Tap, battery saving elements, and a revamped app permissions system. Now on Tap is pretty much now your best friend, on your smartphone. It’ll help you search up pretty much anything you need, keeping your task, scheduling and info always in check. A video below details what you can do with Now on Tap. Technology in the battery department has stalled since the installation of the lithium-ion polymer, causing heartache for those who rely on their devices for most of their life. Google however, wants to help out in terms of improving how your devices utilises the power it has. Doze on Android is just one of them, which puts your Android device into a deep sleep when idle for an extended period to minimize power usage. Tested in “controlled environments” Android techs pit one set of Marshmallow Nexuses’ against another bunch with the older Lollipop – and surprise, surprise, the former ran *roughly* 30% longer (based on standby time). Users will also get another function dubbed App Standby. A feature that puts your lesser opened apps into a state of reduced activity, making your device conserve more power for the apps that you use more often. Privacy options get a much appreciated update, now allowing you to personalise and select which permissions you want to give apps. Users are now able to pick what they want their apps to have access to at the time of use. All apps running on Marshmallow now only request permission when it needs to access one of the device’s functionalities (e.g. microphone, contacts, camera). Rejoice cause now you can deny permissions and still use the app but at a reduced functionality, of course. Permissions can now even be turned on and off for any app, in the new settings. With Android M the arrival of native finger-print support came together. A new (naturally) supported way to interact with your device, giving you power to protect your device in a multiple array of methods. The new OS places your fingerprint at the forefront of safeguarding your information, unlocking your device, authorising payments on the Google Play Store (& more), signing into other apps and paying through Android Pay (if available in your country). Much to be excited about for those who own a piece of Nexus tech and a lot more incentive for consumers to pick up the newest Nexus smartphones; the 5X and 6P. We sure hope that Google Malaysia brings products (officially) to our domestic market soon, cause we’re loving what we’re hearing about Marshmallow so far. Are you?"

But it certainly isn’t cheap because native  isn’t easy to find. Sony’s latest statement answers some questions but we’ll have to see how well it attempts to levitate this problem. What the Japanese manufacturer attempts to do is downgrade non-4K content to a more reasonable 1080p, although it won’t sacrifice any proper 4K content, ensuring you’ll still get the most pixels. Here’s a snippet of what Sony said: They then offer an explanation as for why they decided to do so: It’s great that Sony has chosen to address these concerns and the reasons listed do make sense. Adding to that, the statement goes on to say that presently, the microSD slot handles cards up to 200GB just fine so 4K recordings won’t cause your phone’s memory to be maxed out so quickly. In the instance that you’ve yet to hear about the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium, let us jog your memory a bit.

It’s battery is rated at 3430 mAh; rather big for regular phones but Sony would be the first to show how 4K screens will affect a device’s battery life – they however rate the battery to last up to 2 days (dependent on your personal usage habits, of course). The phone also features Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0, so that should help giving your battery a quick boost if it needs it. You can check out our post   for more info about the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium."

While being dissembled, the people behind the website released info of the internals down to their model numbers, as they usually do. If you’re not familiar with iFixit, they’re the people behind the DIY fixing website for Apple products; they provide how-to’s and even provide the parts for self-repairs (if you’re desperate to look elsewhere). So far, they’ve released an official statement explaining the whole commotion that lead to Apple banning them. They explained that they knew the risk associated with going-ahead to tear down the Apple TV and the fact that “teardowns are in our DNA”, they couldn’t resist. Fittingly, Apple wasn’t too pleased but were fair to weigh the aforementioned decision against the repairing maestros and sent them a follow up e-mail explaining their offences; in-turn, banning the iFixit developer account with the app in tow. It isn’t all bad news though, as the team announced that their mobile site is essentially the exact same thing as the app; allowing the full functionality on the website. Adding that, due to the team being really small, they don’t have enough resources to keep the app up-to-date.

There’s no mention if there’s a difference in trade-up value with larger storage capacity but you can find out more on 16th October when the iPhone 6s is officially available in Malaysia.  Historically, SenQ has been   the latest iPhones on launch day and we expect them to do the same with the latest iPhone 6s.

At 5.7 inches, it is a phablet and could replace the ageing  .  Boasting a multimedia rich experience, the biggest highlight of the V10 is its dual-screen approach. Unlike Samsung’s “Edge” display on the Galaxy Note Edge and S6 edge series, the secondary display is a tiny strip that’s placed at the front, at top right of the main screen. The always-on display which claims to have no impact on battery life and it can be used for status, shortcuts, displaying next appointment and more.  
 Like its current LG G4, it uses a Quad HD (2560×1440) IPS Quantum Display that’s bigger at 5.7 inches with a pixel density of 513ppi. Meanwhile the secondary ticker display is also a IPS Quantum Display unit with a 2.1″ unit doing 160×1040 pixel resolution. For better durability, the V10 has a Dura Guard frame that protects the display from hard bumps and tumbles. The frame is made of SAE grade 316L stainless steel and it protects the most vulnerable areas around the edge and corners. The back and bottom of the device gets a softer material called Dura Skin that’s resistant to scratches. With a grid pattern design, the V10 gets a more reassuring grip when held in the hands.  Under the hood, it gets a Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor and it is mated with 4GB of LPDDR-3 RAM. For imaging, it retains a similar 16MP f/1.8 camera as the LG G4 that also comes with OIS 2.0. In addition, it also gets 3 directional mics which you can be manipulated fully with its Manual Video mode. If you love taking 4K videos, storage shouldn’t be an issue with a 64GB of on-board storage and it still comes with a microSD slot supporting up to 2TB. For the professionals, it has an extensive manual mode and you can even shoot videos in 21:9 aspect ratio.  Over at the front, LG wants to take Selfie and Groufie pictures to the next level with not one but two 5MP cameras with each doing 80 degree and 120 degree wide angle respectively. With the two cameras combined, it can produce a wide angle shot without the need of having a selfie stick. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery which is also removable. In terms of connectivity, it supports Cat 6 4G LTE, 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and it still uses microUSB 2.0. Overall it is 8.6mm thick and it weighs quite a heft at 192g, similar to an iPhone 6s Plus. The LG V10 will be available starting in Korea this month and it will be released later in other regions including Asia, US, China, Latin America and Middle East.

Officially there was no mention on screen size but they said it was all about a larger viewing experience. Possibly occupying a place in our dwellings but not moving around as much as smaller tablets. Spotted on GFXBench benchmarks, we now have a rough idea of what this device is going to be. Codenamed under the model number SM-T670, the monstrous tablet is listed to have an 18.5-inch display at 1920×1080 (FHD); at this size, we’d likely appreciate a higher resolution but we’ll have to see it in real life before making any assumptions. Theoretically the tablet will be viewed further away, more like a TV, so the “bigger” pixels shouldn’t be too noticeable. For it’s processor, it’ll run a 64-bit Octa-core Exynos 7580 processor coupled with a Mali-T720 GPU. This new processor is expected to fit in the mid-range chip-set market, as it’s supposedly only clocked at 1.6GHz; as far as we can tell, bigger model number doesn’t mean that this processor will be anywhere near the Exynos 7440. Similarly, the new processor was seen on the mid-range Galaxy J7 and the device’s benchmarks saw that it beat the Snapdragon 615 – which isn’t saying much. Back to the huge tablet’s specs, the listing also states that it’ll have 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Otherwise, it’ll carry an 8-megapixel rear camera (based on another report) and a measly 2-megapixel sensor on the front (probably just enough for video calls, if necessary). Samsung’s Galaxy View will apparently size at 451.8 x 275.8 x 11.9mm and feature a 5,700 mAh battery; raising some alarms, but it could mean that Samsung assumes you’ll have the device plugged in long-term. It has already been passed   and   certifications, a tell-tale sign that Samsung will probably launch this device soon."

With Google’s Android Wear now  , the LG Watch Urbane 2nd edition supports both Android and iPhones. Previously, the Urbane LTE was running on a proprietary LG Wearable Platform that’s based on WebOS. With 4G LTE support, the Watch Urbane could replace your smart phone as it support voice calls with its integrated speaker and mic.

Placed to fill a gap in the non-metal phones of this year, the Butterfly 3 packs a great package with HTC’s signature dual rear camera setup in a lesser premium outer layer. For a pretty penny, the Butterfly 3 is filled with internals that beg the question, if priced so highly, why not just make metal-clad? It’s been tough for the Taiwanese company to make profits and since September, they’ve been   from the main Taiwan stock index (TWSE 50). Problems don’t just stop there, as the company announced that they would lay off nearly 15% of their global workforce. Market strategies aside, HTC Butterfly 3 is a 5.2-inch device; it’s screen is a QHD LCD display (2560 x 1440). Occupying the processor slot inside the device is an Octa-core Snapdragon 810, while the RAM sits at 3GB. For your storage you’ll get a decent 32GB internally but if you need a boost, you can always take advantage of the microSD slot. The star of the show of the Butterfly line has always been its camera optics, and the third generation device a Duo camera setup; 20.2-megapixels as the primary camera and a secondary lens to help with those bokeh shots. Protected by sapphire crystal it boasts an f/2.2 aperture and a dual-LED module sits on the left of the main sensor. Selfie taking individuals will be pleased as on the front you’ll see a 13-megapixel shutter with a BSI sensor. In terms of aperture, the front lens steps it up a bit with an f/2.0 lens instead. If you prefer videos, the rear sensor gets you 4K quality and the front is capable of 1080p films. Aesthetically, the Boomsound speaker grills are slightly thinner this time around, giving it a sleaker look but still maintaining its large bezels on the top and bottom. Powering the HTC Butterfly 3 is a 2,700 mAh battery and the smartphone has a IP rating of 57, ensuring that it’ll be slightly dust and water resistant. It also has a single 4G LTE SIM slot. Android 5.0 Lollipop is behind the device’s OS but has an overlay of HTC’s Sense 7. The device launches in Taiwan on the 20  of October for TWD 19,.900 (RM 2,657) though no word yet on international availability."

For starters, the front gets a 5.2″ display that pushes a Full HD resolution with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. That’s slightly bigger than the Nexus 5 and the size should be perfect for single handed use. Powering the Nexus 5X is a 2.0GHz Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor which is pretty decent but it is mated to only 2GB LPDDR3 RAM. For storage, it comes only in 16GB or 32GB storage options without expandable microSD.  In the imaging department, the main camera is a 12.3MP f/2.0 shooter with a larger 1.55 μM pixel size and it comes assisted with IR laser auto focus and dual LED flash. For the front, it gets a 5MP f/2.2 camera with a standard 1.4 μM pixel size. Interestingly, the cameras are similar to what was   for the Nexus 6P.  As supported natively with the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the Nexus 5X also comes with a rear mounted fingerprint scanner and it uses the future proof USB Type C connector port. There’s no mention of the battery size but the feature list promises all day battery life. We can only hope that LG can do better this time round as the previous Nexus 5 battery comes with just 2,300mAh capacity.  With Android M, users can expect   as demonstrated on the Nexus 5. With such specs, this should be geared towards value conscious customers compared to its top end Nexus 6P.

This is the Piston 3.0 which succeeds its current   version, that’s priced at RM50.  The new Mi Piston 3.0 is totally redesigned and gone is the metal chambers that usually come in gold, opting for a more ergonomic design with the use of durable plastic. While the previous version was straight, the new version slopes downward slightly with a 120 degree tilt outwards for a comfortable fit.  The diaphragm in the ear piece uses an aerospace-grade metal composite material that’s sandwiched between its PET layers for a more balanced output. For optimal mid-range and bass performance, the sound chambers now has a new spiral air flow design which seems to direct sound better into your ear.  Designed for smart phone usage, the Mi Piston 3.0 also comes with a microphone module that has your typical volume up, down and selection button. Unlike the previous version where the mic is placed at the splitting end of the cord, it is now located on the right side cable, about 3 inches below the ear piece. The cable still uses kevlar fibre that’s encased in a braided sleeve for better durability.  From our long term use, the Piston 3.0 is more sleek in design and we find it to fit better in most ears. We know of some users complaining that the metal chambers of the current Piston 2.1 seem to hurt their ears during long usage, and it seems that the new ergonomic design has solved that. Noise isolation is a lot better and terms of quality, the mid-rangers are clearer while the bass is more warmer and full bodied.

The lucky customers from Johor, Penang, Klang Valley, Sabah and Sarawak had managed to get their hands on their units within 3 hours after completing their purchases on vmall.my. 2 hours into the sale, honor managed to fully sell out its 5,000 available units; understanding this, the Director of E-Commerce Malaysia of the brand has sought out to exceed its customers’ expectation by providing same day delivery. This priority delivery service is made possible through a special arrangement in partnership with Citylink. Malaysia itself, had the honor 7 revealed a week back during the official launch and those who registered their interest were also entitled to redeem a RM 50 discount voucher that can be used for their purchase. Since its launch, they had received 82,000 interest registrations and the first 1,000 additionally received a free 32GB microSD card. Amongst the lucky few were a Kuching native, Kino Sim, who received the device as a surprise gift from his girlfriend. While in KL, Mandy Kuak received the same visit as well. These two excitedly placed orders in the morning and received their honor 7s in 3 hours. The former raved about the device’s practicality and powerful internals that set the honor 7 apart from its competitors. If you haven’t heard of the honor 7, it is a new 5.2-inch flagship that runs a 64-bit Octa-core Kirin 935 processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. For storage, the device gets just 16GB on board but you do get the option to add more using the hybrid 2nd SIM/MicroSD slot that accepts up to 128GB extra. The unibody metal design device carries two cameras; 20-megapixels on the rear, equip with an f/2.0 aperture lens, while the front has an 8-megapixel shutter, brightened by a soft flash if you need it. The honor 7 is juiced by a 3,100 mAh battery, it can charge up pretty quick; 0-50% in 30 minutes, provided you have the optional fast charger. For greater security, you’ll find a squarish finger-print sensor at the back which unlocks in a split second upon a single touch. The honor 7 is priced at RM1,399, you’ll get to choose from either Mystery Grey or Fantasy Silver colours. Want to learn more about this honor flagship? Watch our hands-on video below:"

Seemingly, Asia as a continent is showing a propensity to put aside their PCs to solely rely on their smartphones for their online needs – be it shopping, learning, searching and etc. So Google being Google, they’re tasked to illustrate an image to show how people use the Internet – as quoted by MD SEA Sajith. Essentially, the research serves to encapsulate the behaviours of the world while connecting to their devices – these instances are dubbed “micro-moments” and so far they’re transcending markets in Asia. How hooked are we? Well the insights show that 66% of all Asians own a smartphone, numbers that aren’t trumped by any other region; Americas and Europe are 60% each. Our neighbours down south (Singapore) sit high and mighty with 88%, the country with the fastest internet (South Korea) are at 83%, while Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia come in at 79%, 78% and 77% respectively – Malaysia’s percentile was at 71%. Malaysia’s data shows some trends that might be worrying; to sum it up, Malaysians could be likely to have ADHD, or rather just find it hard to concentrate on one thing – in this case, device for a span of time. Coming in at number 2 thanks to logging a percentile of 91% Malaysia was only beaten by Indonesia (92%); numbers that show that both countries have individuals that use their smartphones while watching the TV. Numbers which implicate that these two nations are either: Then on, the data also shows that 36% of Malaysians only use their pocket companions and nothing else to surf the web – again number two, behind Thailand 37%. It seems that it could be that the portability of their smartphones are driving them away from tablets and computers. Buying habits are now also being dictated through smartphones, although the numbers aren’t too high at 20%. Supplementing this data are more percentages that corroborate that e-commerce is still quite stagnant in the country. 51% of Malaysians prefer to do their groundwork on their purchases online but purchasing the actual item offline. The internet is helping them find out what they need and compare on the internet but knowing Asians, they still want to take a proper look at the thing they’re putting their money towards. Another interesting trend is that 48% of our citizens find out about products through online resources, first. E-commerce as an industry is still finding it hard to tackle the local consumer, but they’ll be happy to know that 30% of Malaysians are shopping online through other mediums (PCs, tablets, etc). Coming to a close, it’s no surprise that the majority of smartphone users come from Gen Y or younger (under 25; 93%) but these numbers are increasing in all age ranges. Some time during this article you’d probably compare yourself and decide if you fall within the majority; nevertheless, consumers could expect more content to be marketed based on these findings, so be prepared for interactive content that spreads across multiple-platforms."
Arif Lee,Make entertainment smarter with Google’s new Chromecast devices,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/30/make-entertainment-smarter-with-googles-2015-chromecast-and-chromecast-audio/,"Chromecast,Chromecast 2015,Chromecast Audio,google,Google annoucement,Google Chromecast 2015,Google Chromecast Audio,Google Nexus,Hi-Fi,speaker,stream stick,TV","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-30,"Ousting the 2 year old version, the new 2015 Chromecast is set to once again offer a better way to make your regular devices smarter; unspecific to it just being a TV anymore, with the Chromecast Audio. Coming in at a small form factor of 39.1grams the new streaming stick and its new music-inclined sibling now boast an improved WiFi frequency support,   to now be a circle and include an integrated HDMI cable. The pre-existing Chromecast used to look much like a stick with a HDMI head, opting for something a little more discrete and easier to plug in, Google has decided to switch to an integrated cable system to make the device easier plug in to hard-to-reach TV ports. The modern-looking Chromecast 2015 now adds support for a wider WiFi frequency; extending to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz with 802.11 ac bands. These bands have allowed Google to prove that the new device adapts to your WiFi surroundings in your home, giving you the best connection at any given time. Hardware aside, its app experience is now tweaked to give you a better overall time while using the device. Content is now shown on a home-screen but only caters to your personal app list, so if you don’t have a certain app, content from it won’t be shown. Though, through content discovery, it’ll show you the available apps that have the content you’ve choose to search for. Picking up (to) Full HD content on apps like Google Play, YouTube, Spotify and Netflix, users will surely have a lot of shows and movies to choose from. The updated Chromecast app wasn’t that slow to begin with but thanks to a pre-fetching option called “Fast Play”, app developers can allow their systems to decrease app load-times (80% faster in a test). Intrinsically, this pre-fetching extends further to utilise algorithms to pre-download content based on your behaviour – e.g. downloading a small bit of a new episode based on your current episode list. What about mobile gaming? Well, gaming is supported too, casting your screen onto your larger screen – now allowing multiplayer options that let users use their devices as controllers. Google also announced its audio only option with similar capabilities; the Chromecast Audio. As mentioned earlier, it’ll make your regular devices a little smarter, allowing you to repurpose your older expensive Hi-Fi systems by making them a streaming machine – similarly to a bluetooth speaker BUT you won’t be interrupted by phone calls anymore, since the device can run on its own without disturbing your listening. Owners can choose from an extensive list of apps like iHeart Radio, Pandora, Google Play Music (not available in Malaysia), Spotify and etc. Google aims to add to their Chromecast Audio app list throughout its lifetime. Some other perks when comparing it to a bluetooth speaker would be less battery drain, ability to use multiple cross-platform devices to control your “new” smart-er speaker. Sharing is enabled through audio sharing on the app that gives users on the same network the capability to control music options on the Chromecast Audio. Best thing is, casting is done on the app you’re playing your music from, so you won’t need to learn an entirely new app just to play music. Later in the year an OTA update will even allow multi-room audio, syncing all your speakers to play from one source. Both devices are readily available in 17 countries (Malaysia left-out) but only cost $35 each (RM 156) and come in 3 colour options – Lemonade, Coral and Black. The devices work with computers or mobile devices that use Android 4.1+, iOS 7.0+, Windows 7, or Mac OS X 10.7 and ChromeOS We’ll be sure to update everyone if/when the two devices come to Malaysia.

They’re more productive than regular mobile devices; the commonality? A keyboard. Yes, the way we type dictate how productive we are, or at least for the time being. So since we’ve seen that drafting long-winded text has always been a headache-inducing experience; hence, Google has reworked their existing Pixel brand to encase a new screen and bluetooth keyboard combination in the form of the Pixel C(onvertible). Could this be a direct answer to the dwindling tablet sales? Convergence devices have a chance to occupy some market share and it seems that most manufacturers are coming up with some sort of variation to tackle this problem. Omitting kickstands and clasps, yet maintaining its rigidity, the device attempts to be a tablet but combining the keyboard through magnets allows you to immediately start your full-on typing jobs. Adjustable to angles from 100 to 135 degrees, when attached, the presentation showed that you can handle it in an array of angles, not coming apart even without being grounded. As an add-on, the bluetooth linked keyboard decreases pitch of the key size from the regular keyboard’s 19mm (13-inch), to the Pixel C’s 18.8mm pitch; the size of keys center to center from each other. It also features a 1.4mm key travel, so typing won’t be too annoying. Stowing the typing add-on is easy, simply placing it under the tablet. Battery-wise it charges inductively when closed through the tablet itself, and a few minutes a day will keep the small keyboard’s battery fully charged, otherwise the keyboard will last for roughly 2 months. In terms of the tablet’s internals, it pushes a 2560 x 1800 pixel resolution through its aforementioned 10.2-inch screen that’s capable of 500 nits of brightness. Running the engine is a quad-core Nvidia Tegra X1 processor with a Maxwell GPU, mated with 3GB of RAM. Internal storage options are available in two choices; 32GB and 64GB. You’ll charge the new Google device through the USB Type-C port, and it has a nifty way of showing the battery percentage, just tap twice on the light bar and it’ll show you a gauge of the current percentage. As for software, it’ll run Android OS leaving out ChromeOS out in the cold. Beckoning the question – are they going to market this solely as a combo? Or will they let the tablet do most of the talking? As is, Android tablets have already had third-party options that allow users to add-on a keyboard, so this is nothing spectacularly new from Google. Some details have been left-out for the time being – like the camera optics, type of screen, and battery size but more info will likely be released at a later date to keep anticipation high. The device today was just teased and Google hopes to release the device by the holiday season. Fortunately, they didn’t withhold pricing and they’ve announced it’ll cost you $499/RM 2,211 (32GB), $599/RM 2,654 (64GB) and $149/RM 660 for the bluetooth keyboard add-on. Google has set up a product page but for now its really bare bones, you can check it out  . Here’s the Google Keynote below (skip over to 1:11:28 for the Pixel C)"
Alexander Wong,Google Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P announced with Marshmallow out of the box,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/30/google-nexus-5x-and-nexus-6p-announced-with-marshmallow-out-of-the-box/,"Android,Android 6.0,Android M,google,Google Nexus,Google Nexus 5X,Google Nexus 6P,Huawei Nexus 6P,LG Nexus 5X,Nexus 5X,Nexus 5X Launch,Nexus 6P,Nexus 6P Launch","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,nexus 5,Nexus 6",2015-09-30,"There’s a saying that good things come in pairs. And that appears to be the formula for new flagships like the Galaxy Note5/S6 edge+ and the more recent iPhone 6s/6s Plus. The Nexus project has always been a showcase of what Google can do if they have full control on both hardware and software.  In its 7th Nexus smart phone generation along with the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, they had introduced not one but 2 Nexus smart phones that cater towards different users. With very little introduction required, the Nexus 5X is their new compact “flagship” while the Nexus 6P is their crème de la crème with a 5.7″ phablet form factor and top spec underpinnings.  With LG being called up for another Nexus duty, the Nexus 5X is an upgrade over its previous Nexus 5 that’s encased in a premium injected molded polycarbonate body. The screen gets a slightly larger 5.2″ size but it still does a modest Full HD resolution. In terms of power, it manages to pull through with a Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor that’s also powering the LG G4. It only gets 2GB RAM with an option of either 16GB or 32GB storage.  Looking at the rear, the Nexus 5X gets a main 12.3MP camera which claims to outdo its better specced rivals. While there are cameras out there with higher pixel count, the 12.3MP shooter from Sony boasts a larger 1.55 μm pixel size, which is pretty much the same formula as HTC’s Ultrapixel shooter.  The main camera has a f/2.0 aperture lens, dual flash light and an IR laser AF for quicker focus. For the front, it gets a rather standard 5MP f/2.0 camera with 1.4 μm pixel size. Audio is pushed from a single speaker that’s firing from the front.  Connectivity wise, it supports a wide range of networks covering Cat 6 4G LTE in TDD and FDD spectrums. It also has WiFi 802.11ac in 2×2 MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC support as standard. For better security, the rear mounted fingerprint scanner that’s called the Nexus Imprint lets you unlock by a mere touch. It recognises in under 600 ms and it learns to get better each time it is being put to use.  Keeping the lights on is a 2,700mAh battery that’s rated for all day use and it charges up using USB Type C that supports Quick Charge. The Nexus 5X is available for pre-orders at selected markets with the 16GB version priced from US$379 (about RM1,690). As seen in earlier leaks, this is the first Nexus phone produced by Huawei. Apart from being a new appointed Nexus maker, it is also the first all metal Nexus smart phone and it boasts a rather slender 7.3mm thickness.  With Huawei being reluctant of pushing a Quad HD smart phones, the Nexus 6P breaks that tradition with a 5.7″ Quad HD display that pushes a stunning 518ppi. To protect the display from harm, it gets toughen with Gorilla Glass 4 and there’s an added oleophobic coating for smudge resistance. The design looks like an odd mix between a Huawei P8 and an honor 7 especially with that visible camera bump. For audio playback, it does get a pair of front firing speakers and recording is assisted by 3 microphones that double up for noise cancellation.  Under the hood, the Nexus 6P runs on a Snapdragon 810 processor mated with 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. You get more storage options ranging from 32GB, 64GB and 128GB which are also non-expandable. The list of connectivity support, Nexus Imprint and USB Type C are similar as the Nexus 5X but the same 12.3MP camera gets an extra trick of having to support a higher Slow Motion recording of 240FPS. Taking selfies should be better as well as the 6P gets a higher 8MP f/2.4 shooter.  In terms of battery, it gets a phablet category 3,450mAh capacity unit which is fitting for the specs it carries. The Nexus 6P is priced from US$499 which is roughly RM2,225 in our current rates.  Both models are quite pricey when compared to mainstream Android smart phones but for the Android purist that want to get the very latest Android might appreciate one of these Marshmallow preloaded smart phones.

The details revealed have reaffirmed a couple of   we’ve heard before. Both Lumia 950 and 950 XL will have Quad HD displays, 20MP Pure View cameras and they will use the new future-proof reversible USB Type C port. While Microsoft is yet to jump onto the fingerprint scanning bandwagon, these new flagships are shown with Iris scanning built-in for  . In terms of OS, they would be the first to run on Windows 10 mobile, in line with its current Windows 10 push.  The Lumia 950 is the smaller version of the lot with a 5.2″ AMOLED display and under the hood, it gets a Snapdragon 808  Hexa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. It will come with 32GB of on-board storage which fortunately is still expandable with microSD. The back gets a 20MP Pureview camera assisted with dual-LED flash while the front will carry a 5MP selfie shooter. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery which supports Qi Wireless charging like its predecessors.  Meanwhile the Lumia 950 XL is a larger phablet sized sibling with a 5.7″ AMOLED display. The screen isn’t the only feature that’s upsized as it gets a top of the line Snapdragon 810 processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM with 32GB of on-board storage. While the main camera is the same 20MP PureView unit, the 950 XL gets an extra boost with a triple LED flash light. For selfies, it still retains the same 5MP shooter as the Lumia 950. With a larger screen, the battery has a slightly bigger capacity at 3,300mAh. It has been a while since Microsoft had launched a flagship smart phone and this is probably the biggest upgrade that matches up with its Android rivals.

A selling strategy that conjured up to ensure that they sell products at an extremely small profit margin. Their stint so far has proven that while people really want to buy their devices, they can’t keep up with the demand. So much so till it has driven Carl Pei to ask Samsung for an internship position, so he’ll be able to learn about being a bigger name in the market. The Shenzen based company, has faced a lot of hurdles since coming to existence in December 2013. They’ve suffered immense pressure to keep up the supply chain, and even daring to declare themselves as the “2016 Flagship Killer”. Maybe Mr Pei’s intentions of heading to Samsung would be to see how they incorporate Fast Charging in their devices; considering OnePlus didn’t include any form of the technology in their 2 devices or perhaps get some insider info on how to kill Samsung’s flagship in 2016. He’s even gone on record on his personal blog, stating that since the OnePlus 2, he’s learned important lessons from not meeting demands of orders. Adding that the company is working overtime just to get their newest device into the hands of their owners. It’s a given really when you intend to have a “one-hour open sale” that caused those on the invite-list to go mad – why have an open sale when you can’t even sell to those already waiting. We’re still not sure if they have a proper team handling marketing but at least they’ve set out to disrupt the market. Tipping the scales in favour of the consumer, so we’ll have to give lift our hats in that aspect. If the industry evolves, there’s likely room for more competition amongst the respective manufacturers – loosely quoting Carl Pei. But this is when it takes the cake, he goes on to say :- We’ll let you be the judge if this is an honest attempt at reaching out or just another stunt that could lead the brand further down the rabbit hole. Subsequently, the guys at Android Authority managed to dig up Pei’s LinkedIn account, which shows that the Co-founder has been around. Take a look at the photo below.  kids could offer Carl some insights on how to successfully get an internship opportunity at Samsung. Take some pointers Mr Pei, they’re way ahead of you."

Sometime down the line the Finnish company decided to sell off 90% of its stakes to a company by the name of EQT VI; who works around the concept of making devices as fashion accessories. Think, Richard Mille, Patek Philippe, Franck Muller and the likes, in the watch making industry; similarly the Vertu Signature Touch aims to occupy the same segment, just for smartphones instead. The prices of their newest devices can fetch from between £6,500 all the way to £13,700, a hefty price for a smart phone. Now with premium prices, you’d expect a premium product, so what goes into making a smart phone that costs roughly the price of a compact car? First off, we’ll take a look at its exterior (yes, we’re treating this like a car impression); the device is fashioned out of expensive materials (go figure), you’ll get polished Grade 5 titanium – the kind you see in the high-end automotive and aerospace industry. Then we have a 130 carat sapphire crystal display ensuring you’ll have the “best” viewing experience. Lastly, the material that surrounds most of the smart phone is leather, and not just any type of leather; we’re talking calfskin, lizard and alligator hides from the best tanneries in Europe. But wait, what about its specs? In this department, the Signature Touch is no slouch either, accompanying its expensive exterior is a 64-bit Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, mated with 4GB of RAM. It’s screen is a 5.2-inch Full HD display, protected by the aforementioned sapphire crystal, while the internal memory is supported by 64GB of storage and features a MicroSD slot (support up to 2TB) that comes with a 64GB card inside. The device’s rear camera stands at a pretty 21-megapixels with phase detect autofocus and a twin Dual-tone LED flash providing better colour accuracy when lit. Moving over to the front, you’ll get a satisfactory 2.1-megapixel wide aperture sensor for those (expensive) selfies. Vertu’s Signature Touch promises to pack a punch when audio is concerned, thanks to its duo of stereo speakers enhanced by Dolby Digital Plus surround sound decoding. For connectivity its equipped with the full WiFi spectrum (a/b/g/n/ac), as well as Bluetooth 4.0, NFC and 4G LTE to boot. Under its titanium housing, you’ll be pleased to find a 3,160 mAh battery that’s readily compatible with Qualcomm QuickCharge 2.0 and also Qi wireless charging. Capping off the smartphone’s specs is the software it runs – Android 5.1 Lollipop with some added Vertu extras bundled with the device. So once you’ve put down that huge wad of cash on the Signature Touch,, it’s expected that it offers you a little more than just being your mobile device; well yes, Vertu has felt the same way, handing its owners an exclusive ruby cut key that gives you access to their added services that include: The phone is available for pre-order in a selected few Vertu boutiques from the 28  of September till the 8  of October, while the device officially goes on sale on October the 16 . The aforementioned prices (£6,500/RM 43,394 to £13,700/RM 91,605) will depend on which options of metal and leather you’ve chosen on your personalised Signature Touch.

In terms of design, it gets a unibody aluminium back with some faux leather elements for the top and bottom. Size wise, it feels quite compact for a 5.5 incher. Over at the front, the display along with its 3 capacitive buttons are flanked by a pair of “metal girder” design grills.  For imaging, it gets a pair of cameras at the back which consists of a 13MP main and a 2MP secondary unit. Meanwhile at the front, it gets a 8MP camera which also doubles up as an iris scanner dubbed as EyePrint ID.  To unlock using your eyes, it isn’t instant as you would need to swipe downwards on the lock screen and wait for about 2-3 seconds for it to work its magic. Alternatively you could also unlock with a fingerprint scanner that’s mounted at the back or via its voice recognition feature.  The ZTE Axon Elite also boast a AKM 4961 HiFi Chip, NFC and a dual-SIM slot which doubles up as a microSD expansion on the 2nd SIM tray. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery which supports QuickCharge 2.0. At the moment, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop and it comes only in Ion Gold colour. The ZTE Axon Elite is priced at RM1,999 and it will be available sometime in mid-October. Being the underdog in the flagship space, the price is quite steep considering there are plenty of high-end devices in this price range."

What stood out is its S Pen which gave the Galaxy Note a unique tool for both work and play. The stylus has been around for ages but it is the S Pen that has taken it to a whole new level for mobile devices. Now it in its 5th generation, the S Pen on the Galaxy Note5 boasts improved functionality and user experience, which lets you do even more with each upgrade.  Here are the 10 things you can do with the S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note5  Great ideas can come at any time and you need to jot it down before it’s gone from your head. With the new Galaxy Note5, you can start scribbling immediately with its new Screen off memo. Just take out the S Pen and start writing. Your notes will be saved under the S Note app. Need to scribble a photo or anything you see on your Galaxy Note5? Be it a website, an image or even a frame of a video, you can start putting your pen into action with Screen Write feature. This allows you to better deliver your message across with illustrations especially when giving directions or providing feedback. To do this, just take out the S Pen, select Screen Write and you can start drawing.  You can also do this from the Photo Gallery by hitting Edit > Write.  Need to be reminded about something? Just write an Action Memo, click on More and Set Reminder. You can set it to alert you at a specific time. For double the reminder, you can even pin it onto the home screen so you won’t forget each time you use your device.  Imagine this, you’re taking down a phone number, an address or even an email. To avoid doing double work, you can use it immediately by tapping on More and Link to Action. From here, you can dial the number, add to contacts, send SMS, email, open a web browser, a location on the map and even convert it into a task list. So less typing and get more things done from your S Pen. When putting your ideas into writing, sharing them in text can be done easier with its smart text conversion feature. Just select the text in the S Note app and select it to Transform into Text. It works even with cursive handwriting too not only in English but in other languages as well. On top of that, it even recognises mathematical formulas as well. For this to work, you’ll need to download the Extension Pack. Need to draw a perfect circle? Not a problem with its Shape Recognition Mode that’s available as part of its Extension Pack. Once installed, it appears on the bottom left of the screen and it will auto correct your shapes when required.  You can create easy to read charts with its Easy Chart Feature under S Note. Just hit insert and select “Easy Chart”. From here you can insert a table, bar graph, line or even a pie chart. Editing the titles and values of each item is easily done by either tapping or sliding with the S Pen.  Any device can take a screenshot but what if the list is long one? Usually you’ll need to take several screenshots which can be troublesome. On the Galaxy Note5, you can take a longer screenshot with Scroll Capture. Just take a regular “Screen Write” and tap on the Scroll Capture icon on the bottom left. You can decide how many pages you would like to capture and you can hit done to end it.  Need to put a comment or a remark? You are free to edit the captured image before sharing it to your contacts.  Sometimes there are documents that you’ll need to sign off but you’re far away from your desk. Instead of having it printed and scanned back again, you can digitally sign off document with its Write on PDF feature. Just open the PDF via the “Write on PDF”, sign off and hit save. This saves time and it is just as good as sending over an actual hand signed copy. The Air Command pops up everywhere the S Pen is removed from its Silo. Apart from giving you access to its S Pen features, you can customise up to 3 favourite apps directly onto your fingertips. This can be used from anything from your social, office, or even gaming apps from the Air Command shortcut interface. There you have it, the 10 things you can do with the S Pen on the latest Samsung Galaxy Note5. While the competition has just started with the stylus game, the S Pen has been vastly improved and it is the best productivity stylus that you can use today."
Arif Lee,BlackBerry CEO struggles with the new Android-running Priv (Venice) in a hands-on video,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/28/blackberry-ceo-struggles-with-the-new-android-running-priv-venice-in-a-hands-on-video/,"Android,blackberry,BlackBerry Android,BlackBerry Android Device,BlackBerry Android Smart Phone,BlackBerry PRIV,Blackberry Slider,BlackBerry Smart Phone,BlackBerry Venice","Android,BlackBerry,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-28,"Once a brand identifies itself and sets habits, they’re often hard to get rid of. Especially so when John Chen, CEO of BlackBerry tried his hand at the demo-unit of the new BlackBerry Priv; the first Android running device from the manufacturer. Well it’s safe to say that Mr. Chen uses a BlackBerry (10) himself, seeing he tried to swipe up in the video you’ll see below. Providing an exclusive hands-on, the CEO talked about how the brand identifies to give its customers privacy, security and privilege, while handling the device – that wasn’t set up yet. The short time with the device was spent more on how the company has decided to give other OS’ a go, since they can’t keep up with competitors’ app ecosystem. He also gave us a look at the slider in action, mentioning that the QWERTY keyboard will have capacitive keys. Recapping the rumoured specs, the Priv runs a 6-core Snapdragon 808 processor and 3GB of RAM under the hood. Curved in nature (a first for BlackBerry) the 5.5-inch screen is purported to display in Quad HD resolution. For its camera, it’ll be sporting an 18-megapixel rear shutter with dual-LED flash, while the front gets a 5-megapixel camera. As you saw on the video, the Priv runs Android; apparently 5.0 but it’ll also have some of the BlackBerry exclusive apps like BlackBerry Hub. A stumble for sure, perhaps BlackBerry could’ve asked their top technology guy to handle the preview of the device instead. Hopefully they’ll buck up during their launch presentation, or at least get the demo unit set up properly – as it is estimated to launch around November. If you’re a BlackBerry user, tell us what you think about the notion of switching over to Android in the comments below."

With about 2 days to go, the purported presentation slides for the Nexus 6P have surfaced online, revealing almost everything you need to know about the latest phablet.  Firstly, the new Nexus 6P is the first Nexus flagship to feature an all metal build. Instead of a 6 incher (5.96″) like the current Motorola based Nexus 6, the new 6P that’s made by Huawei is going for a slightly smaller 5.7″ display. It pushes a Quad HD resolution that’s protected by Gorilla Glass 4. Accompanying the display is a pair of front ported speakers similar to its predecessor.  Under the metal body, the Nexus 6P runs on Qualcomm’s Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 v2.1 processor that’s found on most flagships today. There’s no mention of RAM but it comes with a variety of storage sizes – 32GB, 64GB and 128GB. As usual, there’s no expandable storage via microSD. For the first time on a Nexus, it will get USB Type-C which supports both faster data transfer and Quick Charge. At the back, there’s also a fingerprint scanner, that lets you unlock or skip passwords at a single touch. For imaging, the deck didn’t reveal exact pixel count numbers but its “Nexus Camera” is said to have been improved for better low light shots. Paired with its Google camera app, it promises quicker capture while keeping your subject in focus.  . : According to   which has gotten a couple of more slides, the camera is confirmed to be a 12.3MP f/2.0 unit that comes with a larger 1.55 μM pixel size which allows more light. Meanwhile at the front, it is expected to carry a 8MP camera that has a standard 1.4 μM pixel size.  With a 3,450mAh capacity battery, the Nexus 6P weighs 178 grams. That’s quite remarkable as it is 230mAh more than the current Nexus 6 but it is still lighter by 6 grams. The biggest change in terms of experience is definitely Android M as it comes with a couple of tweaks on app management, power efficiency and native support for more features including a fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C.  : The Nexus 6P   at US$499.99 (about RM2,215) for the 32GB storage option. It will be available in 4 colours – Aluminium, Graphite, Frost and Gold, with the last colour surprisingly exclusive initially for Japan.

We compared the current deals offered by  ,   and   for your easy reference. Check them out after the break.  
 Getting an iPhone in Singapore is quite expensive to start with, no thanks to our current 1 SGD = RM3.08 exchange rate. Being an import or AP set, there’s an obvious premium to pay on top of the original price.  The cheapest iPhone 6s with 16GB can be yours starting from RM3,559 on   but this is limited to the more classic Silver and Space Grey colours. Meanwhile, the phablet sized iPhone 6s Plus starts from RM4,699 for 16GB from both SatuGadget and Lazada.  Across the board, the gold colours would cost more due to anticipated higher demand and it is more extravagant for the new pinkish Rose Gold. If you do plan on shooting lots of 4K videos, it is advisable to   and go for at least 64GB.  If money is no object to you, the iPhone 6s Plus with 128GB storage is sold starting at RM5,945 on Lazada and it goes up to RM7,288 for the Rose Gold colour option. That’s seriously a lot of money to pay and history has always proven that there are always people willing to spend that insane amount.  : The iPhone 6s/6s Plus will be   on 16th October. Better to wait for the official sets which are also available on contract from our telcos.  : Some sellers have started throwing price with the iPhone 6s 16GB   RM3,199 on Lazada. That’s below the market price since it is priced at S$1,048 in Singapore, which is about RM3,282.  For a more sensible purchase, you can probably wait until sometime in   when it is expected to launch officially in Malaysia. Looking at Apple’s constant  , do expect to pay more compared to previous years. The prices above are correct at time of writing and they are subject to change without prior notice.

It might seem a little odd seeing one of the Chinese smartphone brands that we know and love suddenly out some high end audioware, but believe it or not OPPO had its roots in audio way before they started producing phones. Here we have the OPPO PM-3 Planar Magnetic Headphones, the cheapest option of their high end series of headphones alongside their headphone amplifier-slash-battery pack the OPPO HA-2. In case you’re not sure what a “Planar Magnetic Driver” is, it’s basically a sound driver that generates sound via a thin diaphragm using a magnetic system. It’s generally pretty stable and produces minimal distortion."

Overall the new 7000 series aluminium held up quite well, merely scuffing when dropped in the last two orientations.

The thinnest and lightest round smart watch you can buy,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/24/the-pebble-time-goes-round-the-thinnest-and-lightest-round-smart-watch-you-can-buy/,"Pebble,Pebble Smart Watch,Pebble Time,Pebble Time Round,Pebble Time Round order,Round Smart Watch,Smart Watch","Mobile Devices,Smart Watch",2015-09-24,"Not too long after releasing its   series, Pebble has just introduced its new Pebble Time Round. Moving away from the typical square and toyish design, the new Pebble looks like a traditional watch with a variety of colours and bands to match. Furthermore, it is the lightest and thinnest smart watch yet weighing from just 28 grams with a thickness of 7.5mm.  Like the new mainstream smart watches, the Pebble Time Round comes in 2 strap sizes, a 14mm size for the ladies and a broader 20mm version for men. It is slightly narrower than the typical 22mm size on the previous Pebbles and the bands are easy to swap with its quick change mechanism. For now, it comes with just leather bands and the metal versions would be made available later. In total there are 3 options (Silver, Rose Gold, Black) available for the 14mm Pebble Time Round and just 2 (Black and Silver) for the larger 20mm version. In terms of design, it looks pretty sleek with its marine grade stainless steel body and the watch display is an always-on colour E-Paper unit, just like the Pebble Time. It has the same buttons with a back button on the left and the typical 3 navigation buttons on the right, so usability hasn’t changed if you’re using the current Pebble Time. It still gets a built-in microphone that’s used for voice commands. When compared to other smart watches, you’ll notice a much thicker bezel but Pebble somewhat has managed to mask it with a variety of patterns from circular lines to numeric markers for the hour and minutes.  The biggest sacrifice of going round and thin would be its battery life. Instead of the usual 7 to 10 days of use, the Pebble Time Round is rated to last just up to 2 days on a single charge. According to Pebble this is a worthy trade off for style and the new Time Round also supports quick charge, giving 24 hours of use with a quick 15 minutes charge. So a full charge for 2 days use in theory can be done in just 30 minutes, which is heaps faster than the Apple Watch. Charging is still done with its magnetic USB charger that snaps onto the back of the watch.  Another trade off for the Pebble Time Round is it isn’t as water resistant as before. On the previous Pebbles including the Time Steel, it can be submerged under 30 metres of water with its 5 ATM rating. The Pebble Time Round however is only splash resistant even with its IPX7 rating. The product page has explicitly mentioned: “Pebble Time Round is splash resistant but not waterproof. Incidental exposure to water–like unforeseeable rain–won’t ruin your device, but submerging the watch is not recommended.” No doubt the Pebble Time is more basic in “smart features” as compared to the Moto 360, Samsung Gear S2, Huawei Watch and LG Urbane. For Pebble, it isn’t about cramming the most tech but the main focus is on building a functional watch that tells the time 24/7 without sleep with the capabilities of notifications and apps. It is a pretty looking thing but we expected them to at least maintain the impressive 7 days of battery life. The good thing about Pebble is that it supports both Android and iOS devices, giving it a wider compatibility than other smart watches out there.  If you’re interested, it is available for   at US$249.99 (RM1,095) with shipping to start sometime in November. Want something simpler? The original Pebble Classic is   for US$99 (RM438)."

There’s still some uncertainty surrounding the whole matter though, as the supposed successor to the Vibe X2 had already been   on TENNA’s site; only carrying a different spec sheet and additional “Vibe” branding on the back.

The same device has already been spotted in the wild, at a 2015 Chinese Telecommunications Expo, no less; so it definitely exists, but no confirmations of specs are to be seen. When will we see it being released and what specs will it carry? Your guess is as good as ours, but it’ll be soon enough, if the certification appearances are anything to lead on. We’ll be sure to keep everyone updated as we know more. A big thank you to   for the SIRIM tip."

Most mainstream players have announced their flagships for the 2nd half of this year, which includes the Galaxy Note5, Sony Xperia Z5 and the iPhone 6s/6s Plus. If you are expecting HTC to come out with a new flagship to close the gap, you could be in for a disappointment.  The new HTC Aero was initially   to run on MediaTek’s top of the line Helio X20 processor that comes with 10 cores. However based on the recent information from @evleaks, the new HTC One A9 is likely to be a premium mid-ranger instead, which is more of a direct competitor to the   and the   series. Even the model name   seems to be poking fun at Samsung’s Galaxy A series.  Instead, it gets a more mainstream 5″ Full HD display, a Snapdragon 617 processor that’s mated with just 2GB of RAM and has 16GB of storage on board. For imaging, it has a 13MP main camera with OIS while the front retains HTC’s 4MP Ultra-pixel camera. The Aero is meant to be a fashion centric device with a slender unibody metal design at 7mm thick. As usual, HTC is rumoured to pack a smaller battery with just 2,150mAh capacity. As seen in the new pic above, there’s a fingerprint scanner at the front but surprisingly it is missing a speaker grill at the bottom.  Just a few hours ago, @evleaks has also shared the 6 colour options available, which looks like a collection of iPod Touches. In summary, this isn’t going to replace its current One M9 but instead it is a possible successor of the former  . The new HTC One A9 is expected to be released in November and hopefully this could be priced competitively to attract the masses."

It doesn’t help either that manufacturers place an absurd amount of emphasis on the number of pixels a camera carries. Problems at the time with Qualcomm’s hot Snapdragon 810 processor saw LG look off and choose the 808 SoC instead; lets keep our fingers crossed that the 820 is the product of Qualcomm learning from their past and they’ve managed to keep it cool.

The tech giant has also moved the battery from the sides to underneath the coloured display. It’ll also include an altimeter; if we understood what Microsoft Insider reported as sensor to measure the “height of an exercise”. Accented with what looks like metal on its side, the Band 2 will supposedly include an optical heart sensor, accelerometer/gyrometer, GPS tracking, a microphone, ambient light sensor, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and UV sensor. Being the City That Never Sleeps, NYC will host the Microsoft event on the 6  of October – rounding off a busy few weeks that’s already seen the city host Apple and soon to go ahead with LG as well. Summing up, it seems like the second generation Microsoft wearable device could be a great update. Tell us what you think Microsoft will throw in the pot during its event in October in the comments below."

We’ve all heard of   having massive security flaws, causing malicious affects on user data and devices. The same goes for   on iOS that was recently afflicted with the XcodeGhost code in its app – so the question remains, what alternatives do we have? Coincidences are great, especially when they work in your favour, thus, Celcom wants to provide you a way “to maintain fullest control of privacy for” your chats and messages with Zipit Chat. The app seeks to implement the aforementioned encryption to secure your chats, emails, voice over IP (VoIP) and files that you’ll transfer to others. Other than the encryption, it’ll also protect your passwords by allowing the app to reset your device and disable the screen capture option on other devices. Zipit Chat also gives you control over your media and phone book, by switching to private mode, while the same function can offer users to make their messages self-destruct. Users can pick if they want their conversations to remain “invisible” by putting conversations in stealth mode – by masking the user’s ID. Chats on a one-to-one basis are encrypted by default, and only the two people in the conversation can view the messages through a provided unique decryption key. The same goes for group chats, offering the same mutual unique key for opening content. Emails too are protected and even the major email providers below are supported: Zipit Chat can be purchased for RM 10/month on the   for Android with Celcom  looking to launching the iOS version next month onwards. Though, for a limited time the service will be free to use until the 22th of November 2015, so while it lasts do check it out (take note of the T&Cs)"

A quick flashback to early September saw the honor Malaysia’s   announce that they had finally set the date for their most premium honor yet. Prior to the post, we flew off to London to take a first-hand look at the   that we felt delivered on its part, quite well – considering its beefy specs and its price-point. Locally, it’s sad to note that we’ll be receiving only the 16GB version, while back home (China) the brand packs an additional 64GB option giving users more storage space. Not such a huge issue, if you make use of the microSD slot that lets you expand that memory by an additional 128GB. We’ve mentioned that the device is sleak and it brings a whole new premium feel to the honor lineup, as it is fashioned out of a single unibody of metal (for the most part). To reintroduce you to the  , it has a 5.2-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) plastered up front, utilising an IPS-Neo technology display. That plus, a beastly 64-bit Octa-core Kirin 935 processor, mated with 3GB of RAM – surely to give you ample amounts of processing power for day to day usage. Its images will be taken care of by a 20-megapixel lens with an aperture of f/2.0 on the back, while your front facing photos are captured by an 8-megapixel shutter equip with soft flash. We did a camera comparison  , so check it out to see how the honor 7 stacked up to other flagships. The smartphone is powered by a 3,100 mAh battery that will take you from 0-50% in only 30 minutes with its optional fast charger. On the back together with its rear camera, you’ll notice a squarish finger-print sensor, which will enable you to simplify the device’s security through biometric recognition. Adding to its extensive features, users can also call out their new honor 7’s with its voice recognition software ready to assist you through commands like: A great package that scales at 157 grams, 8.5mm thick and runs a home-grown OS in the form of EMUI 3.1 on top of Android 5.0 Lollipop. It even has dual-SIM (nano) LTE capabilities, for its affordable price range but as always, you’ll sacrifice one SIM slot for the microSD card. In the past, all honor devices have been exclusively sold online, so this time should be no different. If you want to pick up one yourself, you can register your interest at the   (1pm onwards), to entitle you for the pre-order – actual sales begin on the 28th of September, in conjunction with Mycybersale. Priced at RM 1,399 (w/ GST), you’ll get to choose from two colour options, Mystery Grey or Fantasy Silver. Taking into account of the pricing, we still feel it’s decent, albeit not having NFC. Huawei has even thrown in some freebies like a free RM 50 voucher and 6 months of screen replacement; best of all for the first 1000 to register for the pre-order will receive a free 32GB microSD card to slot into their devices.

The aforementioned camera shares a horizontal line with the Dolby Atmos audio speakers, which we’ve yet to fully experience (we’ll update on how it sounds when we can).

Though, the iOS App Store, has relatively been safe, recently Chinese developers have inadvertently implanted a spoofed version of the Xcode software that’s used by Apple on some of their apps. The XcodeGhost file was uploaded on Baidu, a site that serves as a file sharing platform; unaware of this, some Chinese developers accidentally used the malware-embedded code for their apps, hence the malicious code making its way on to the App Store.

The Korean phone maker is changing it up this time around, as their latest device is more metal than ever before, carved out of a single block of metal, this unibody device carries a 5-inch (1280 x 720) display. A let down to many that in this generation feel that screens should at least be 1080p but moving along, it’s designed with 2.5D curved glass – easing ergonomics for those concerned but being a 5-inch device, it should be a non-issue. Other internals include 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage (expandable). The mid-ranger will be equip with 4G LTE, NFC but only have a 2,050 mAh battery on board; fueling reasons to why they may have chosen the lowly Quad-core Snapdragon 410 chip, that clocks at only 1.2GHz. The device weighs in at 147grams and runs Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. So far the LG Class has been classified as a domestic-only product but if you’re still interested it retails at KRW 399,300 aka RM 1,451 (at that price, you’ll be able to purchase the ASUS Zenfone 2 or the OnePlus 2, if you can get an invite). That said, we’re not sure what direction LG is going for but if they manage to price this lower and team up with Korean telcos well enough, they just may see some market demand. Do tell us what you think about LG’s new device, does it compete well at its price-range? Would you buy it? Do you like the direction LG’s design team is heading towards (with more metal and less polycarbonate)?"

Seen as a mid-range phablet, as far as specs show in the info section of its benchmarking, LG could look at this to be the successor to its 5.9-inch G Pro 2. Rumours have mentioned that the Korean company will name the H740 as the LG Class, and the company’s social media channels have been actively teasing an announcement on the aforementioned date. Although, the specs don’t really deserve a second glance, it’ll be fully constructed in metal, which could mean LG is changing its stance on its removable battery and plastic bodies for a more premium feel and look. Some things still remain as brand trademarks; seeing the button placements haven’t moved from the back but there seems to be a thin line that looks like a speaker grill, now nearing the top. The device in question will come with ample screen estate, being a phablet sized 5.7-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen and carry an assumed Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor. It’ll also come with 2GB of RAM and possibly 8GB of internal storage (we’re hopeful its expandable). The camera optics of this device could be either a 12 or 13-megapixel sensor on the rear, assisted by a 5-megapixel camera on the front. Seeing that it carries the 615 chipset, it should come with LTE capabilities and will run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box.

New reports by the people behind underkg seem to show the alleged “phablet” having a much smaller footprint. So what about the 5.7-inch phablet we saw in the Geekbench benchmarks? We’re not quite sure, it seems that there may be two devices out there that’s soon to be launched by LG (aside from the   in October). Though, the photo also brings confirmation of the Class being built out of real metal, not those faux metal (plastic) shells finishes. It’s well possible that LG is trying out this all metal design to combat the brand’s lack of premium feeling phones, instead of opting for those (good quality) polycarbonate designs that has made their mobile brand what it is today. A bid to unseat Samsung’s ‘A’ series perhaps? All we can say is LG G4 didn’t perform to the company’s expectations so maybe a change of direction might be good for the smartphone maker. What else does this latest report confirm? Only the fact that the images show the branding of one of South Korea’s mobile telco carrier’s, and possible pricing in the aforementioned country – KRW 400,000, roughly translating to RM 1,457. Nonetheless, LG has a tendency to release phones only for its home-country, but if you could, would you buy this device?"

Under the hood, it runs a newer A9 chip and 2GB of RAM, which is   of its predecessor. For taking pictures, it finally gets a bump to 12MP, which is the first camera upgrade since the iPhone 4S. The front camera is now a 5MP shooter and you can use the Retina display for selfie illumination in low light situations. You can read more about it in our iPhone 6s  . In terms of iPhone 6s local availability, we probably need to wait for sometime in November like last year’s iPhone 6. Our southern neighbour Singapore has commenced its pre-orders last week with actual shipping to start next Friday. If you want to get one,   at least RM3,200 for the 16GB in Singapore, no thanks to current exchange rates. The new iPhone 6s does shoot 4K videos and we strongly advise you   if you plan on recording videos a lot. As for the  , there’s still no news until today and if you want to get one, it is already available in both Thailand and Singapore."

As seen earlier, the Mi 4c gets a hardware upgrade with a  , which should make up for the   of its international version. Apart from getting a faster processor, Xiaomi has also confirmed that it will use a future-proof USB Type-C connector. If you’re worried about cable issues, Xiaomi has also posted that there will be a little nifty accessory that lets you charge using existing micro USB cables. So far it isn’t clear it the microUSB to Type C adapter comes included in the box, but do expect this to be priced cheaply if sold separately.  The rest of the specs are pretty much the same as before with a 5″ Full HD display, 2GB of RAM and the option of 16GB or 32GB of storage. For cameras, it would be utilising a 13MP main sensor at the back while the front gets a 5MP shooter. Battery is said to be more than 3,000mAh which is likely to be of the same capacity as the Mi 4i.  Xiaomi’s Weibo page has been teasing its upcoming event with the title “the prince is coming”. Since this is a Chinese market device, we are not too sure if it will be sold outside mainland China. Perhaps it could come as an enhanced version of the Mi 4i which currently runs on a Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB RAM. Hopefully the USB Type C connector port supports Fast Charge with faster data transfer rates."

Unfortunately things doesn’t seem to go well as planned.   Like the name suggests, the Move to iOS app is designed to make switching from Android to an iPhone easier. It allows you to transfer existing photos, messages, contacts, calendars and more over WiFi. With Android die hard fans seeing this as a blasphemous act, they had raged a “Review” war by downloading the app and then leaving some deliberately poor ratings along with some interesting remarks.  Some of the comments are hilarious with one claiming that he is turning into a sheep and another reporting the app is fake as it turned his LG G3 into a BlackBerry curve. There are those that are demanding Google to remove such app as Apple themselves would not allow such app to exist on their own App Store.

As usual, there will be loads of people trying to get their hands on one especially in mainland China.

Nope, you won’t even need to lose any of your   to get it and it is easier than you think.  In a populous country with over a billion people, China surprisingly is in dire need to fill up 18 sperm banks around the country. Struggling to attract new donors, they have started a campaign that offers an easier way of obtaining an iPhone 6s. All they need to do is to make a donation at a sperm bank.  The Hubei Human Sperm Bank had sent out a message over WeChat that links to an article entitled “New ways to get an iPhone 6s”. Inside it explains that the bank is seeking donors aged 22 to 45, with each to receive 5,000 CNY (about RM3,321) in subsidies. This in return would make them a step closer of buying an iPhone 6s that’s priced at 5,288 CNY (about RM3,512). So far there’s no word of its reception but the intimate deal has managed to get quite a lot of attention recording over 400,000 reads.  You must be wondering why sperm donation is a concern in China considering they have strict population control. According to a research by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, the sperm fertility of Chinese males has been dropping by 1% each year since the 80s. With the mad desire for the latest iPhone, this is probably the safest and less excruciating route for those without cash to spare."

That’s 4X the resolution of a standard Full HD 1080p clip. While most TVs and displays are still pushing full HD, there are those who prefer to capture moments in the best quality possible in 4K. There’s nothing wrong with that but the biggest concern is always on storage. With greater detail comes bigger file size and that could be a problem if you’re intending of buying the cheapest iPhone model available. MKBHD has gotten a hands-on with the new iPhone 6s and has shared some info on the new video formats. Under the settings page, a 4K video at 30fps would take around 375MB/minute of recording while a standard Full HD 1080p takes up just 130MB/minute. That’s nearly triple the file size just to shoot in the highest quality. Like most smart phones, you don’t really get the full available space as advertised as the storage is often partitioned for the operating system and bundled apps. So if you’re getting a 16GB iPhone 6s, you’re probably left about 10GB of free space once you’ve installed and set up all your essential apps. With just 10GB, that leaves you with enough space for just 27 minutes of 4K video.  If 4K video recording is your thing, it is recommended that you take at least the 64GB model or 128GB if you could afford that extra premium. Alternatively, you can free up more space from time to time with the  , which is like a thumb drive for your phone.

Surely it is better than the iPad mini 3 and it really is.  As usual, there’s nothing new with the design so it still retains the unmistakable iPad mini appearance with its unibody aluminium body. However Apple has made some significant changes on the overall dimensions. It is only 6.1mm thin, which is the same as the  , the thinnest for an iPad.  In addition, they have also made some weight reductions bringing it down from 331g previously for the WiFi version to just 298.8g. Likewise, the WiFi + 4G Cellular versions which used to weigh 340g on the iPad mini 3 is now just 304g.  The display is still the same 7.9″ incher but they have improved it with the same fully laminated display as the iPad Air 2 with additional anti reflective coating. In the camera department, it gets the same combo as the bigger iPads with an 8MP f/2.2 main camera which now brings Burst shots and Slow-mo onto an iPad mini. Meanwhile the front still gets the same 1.2MP unit. The most welcome change is the processor, where it gets a newer A8 chip but it is still a notch below the A8X chip that’s powering its top of the line iPad Air 2. Apple claims that the A8 is 1.3x faster in processing and 1.6x faster in graphics than the previous A7.  With   being released very soon, the new Split View feature allowing you to run 2 apps side by side was previously exclusive just to the iPad Air 2, (and now iPad Pro) likely due to processor requirement. The new upgraded processor allows the iPad mini 4 to use split view, so this is good news for multi-taskers that prefer to use a smaller iPad. In terms of connectivity, it supports faster 802.11ac WiFi as well as Bluetooth 4.2. The battery life remains unchanged with up to 10 hours of use in a single charge."

An overhaul that sees it now carrying a powerful 64-bit A8 CPU and PowerVR GX6450 GPU, together with 2GB of RAM. Significant jumps in each category; that sees Apple also adding more internal storage (32GB or 64GB), a better WiFi radio (802.11ac) and even a redesigned tvOS. A great operating system that will see the Apple TV now support Apps and have an accelerometer and gyroscope on its newest remote. Connectors on the small black box are similar on past editions, a power, HDMI and an ethernet port. With an addition of the app store for tvOS, Apple hopes that its third-party developers will expand and further the device’s functionality that places a new emphasis on gaming. You’ll be using the newly designed remote that comes with a glass touch pad on the top end that connects to your box through Bluetooth 4.0.

It’ll probably have the same traits as its predecessor, only with larger search functionality.

You’ll be able to ask the female personal assistant things like: Apple TV’s gaming experience will now have a shot at rivaling the Nintendo Wii, thanks to the new Siri remote that includes the accelerometer and gyroscope. During the keynote we saw a multiplayer game dubbed Crossy Road, which allows users to tether an iPod Touch or iPhone as an additional remote. Also demoed, was Beat Sports, a music and sports combo that sends music timed baseballs for you to hit. Apple’s main showcase to its new gaming element will be Disney Infinity 3.0, Guitar Hero Live and Rayman Adventures’, surely pleasing a wide range of gamers out there. A further extension of apps bring about a demonstration of online shopping directly on Apple TV, thanks to companies like Gilt – giving Apple an edge when compared to other set-top boxes out there.

In terms of colours, Apple is still retaining the same Silver, Space Grey and Gold but it now gets a Rose Gold colour option which is a more feminine with a pink hue. Nothing has changed in terms of storage as Apple continues the same 16GB, 64GB and 128GB capacity options. Personally we wished Apple had killed the 16GB option and set 32GB as the bare minimum for a flagship.  After toying around with Force Touch trackpads and watches, the pressure sensitive tech has finally made its way onto the iPhone as 3D Touch. This gives the multi-touch display another form of interaction as it is able to differentiate soft to hard presses. With a gentle touch, you can now preview links while hard presses bring up additional shortcuts and menus on iOS 9.  From the home screen, you can jump straight into selfie or slow-mo videos by hard pressing on the camera icon. Alternatively you can jump straight to Inbox or New Message when you do the same on the Mail icon. In short, this is like having a right click function on a computer. Developers can also take advantage of 3D Touch as well with games making use of the finger pressure for additional controls.  The iPhone 6s/6s Plus also gets a Taptic engine which gives a more immersive feedback as you force touch into the display. Like the Apple Watch, this gives you a sensation of a glass being tapped or pressing through the glass that feels more realistic than the conventional buzzing vibration. Speaking of touch, the Touch ID fingerprint scanner has been improved with its 2nd generation unit, promising quicker response time than before. As the competition   its camera capabilities, Apple has finally upgraded its iSight camera in pixel count from 8MP to 12MP with f/2.2 aperture. This is the first major camera upgrade since the iPhone 4S. It still gets dual-tone LED flash for more natural lit pictures while the 6s Plus has the additional feature of Optical Image Stabilisation. Finally 4K Video recording is supported and you can make ultra high resolution movies on the fly with its built-in editing tools. For Selfies, the front FaceTime HD camera has been upgraded from 1.2MP to 5MP f/2.4. To illuminate your face in the low light conditions, the new iPhones get Retina Flash, which basically increases the front display brightness by 3X as a light source.   Another neat feature is Live Photos where it starts shooting before the point of shooting a picture until after a few seconds after that. This gives you a short clip which actually consists of multiple shots and it is done automatically on every single photo that you take, which is kind of similar to HTC’s Zoe. To preview the Live Photo, just simply press harder onto a picture in the gallery for a quick playback.  Only for the US, Apple has introduced its   where anyone can switch to the latest iPhone every single year. It works quite similar to   where you sign up for a 24 months installment plan with an added option to change phone every 12 months.  According to Apple, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be priced the same as its predecessor at launch and they have reduced the price of its current models. The iPhone 6 Plus in the US carries the same contract price tag as iPhone 6s. With immediate effect, the iPhone 5C has been discontinued, making the iPhone 5S their new entry-level smart phone available. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are still in the market but it is now limited to just 16GB and 64GB options. Colour wise, you’re limited to just Space Grey and Silver. So if you want to get a gold iPhone, you’ll have to go for the very latest model.  Pre-order starts this Saturday on 12th September with official sales to begin on 25th September in first wave countries. As usual Malaysia won’t be among the early batch of countries but if you want, you can try your luck in  ,  ,   and  .  When it gets here, we can only assume there will be another round of price hike due to our weakening Malaysian Ringgit against the dollar which currently stands at US$1 = RM4.34.

With the   app store now supporting 10,000 apps that make use of more 3  party complications, accessing the watch’s hardware – ranging from the mic to its other health related in-built sensors. Apple has even stepped up the personalisation of their two (out of three) watch models. App developers are now tooled to improve their apps thanks to watchOS 2, letting them play around with the watch’s hardware, opening doors to apps like iTranslate; for giving you voice translations on the fly, or the GoPro app, that lets you use your watch display as a viewfinder. Innovating in other fields like those involved in medicine, AirStip has already existed on other iDevices (iPhone and iPad) but with an upgrade to watchOS 2, the app now gives medical practitioners and the hospital team easier accessibility to patient records and their health readings. Daily rounds are displayed on the app, connecting the team within a network that lets them communication and share patient data on a more productive level. Time travel is now enabled and turning the digital crown lets you go through your daily rounds schedule to see upcoming patient visits and other appointments. Developers are also bringing another health monitoring app to the table, with Sense 4 Baby opening the same doors but for mothers and doctors that want to monitor a baby’s health while still in a womb. Sensors placed on the mother’s belly allows this and doctors can get an NST reading straight after the mother does a test at home – making the whole affair a more practical one. To the aesthetic side of things, Apple now adds to its collaboration list with Hermes joining forces to provide luxury watch bands and its own distinctive watch face with Hermes iconography. Hand-stitched leather in 3 options the Double Tour ($1,250/RM5,465), Single Tour ($1,100/RM4,852), and Cuff ($1,500/RM6,557) seems to be Apple’s venture into the more fashionable side of smart wearables. The French artisans made the first option to wrap twice around your wrist, coupling feminine elegance with security of mind. Available for the 38mm stainless steel case, this leather band will come in 4 colours – Fauve, Etain, Capucine and Bleu Jean. Wrapping only once around your wrist, the Single Tour attempts to appeal to both men and women and are available in the 38mm and 42mm stainless steel case. However, the single only comes in the Fauve and Noir, with an additional Capucine band for the 38mm. Hermes caps it off with the Cuff leather option, said to be created to stay in contact with the wrist better for a more accurate heart rate monitoring. It is only available in the 42mm stainless steel case in a Fauve colourway. Subsequently, Apple has also been busy updating their own designs, as two new finishes are now added to the line-up – Gold and Rose gold (38mm and 42mm) are now available in iodised aluminium. Two great colours that maintain the pricing of the original sports line up ($ 349/RM1,526 for 38mm, $ 399/RM1,736 for 42mm). There’s also a product RED version of the stainless steel case, which will have part its proceeds directed towards fighting AIDS. Although most of the updates are already available, the Hermes collection and watchOS 2 are slated to be out in October and September the 16 , respectively. Unfortunately, Malaysia is once again left out of the list, so we’ll wait and see if Apple decides otherwise in the future."

In our last  , most of you   the  , followed by the   as the camera of choice. With the   released with a similar 16MP sensor, is it better than the rest of today’s new smart phones? To find out, we’ve taken pictures with 10 devices and we are letting you decide which is the better shooter. For this shootout, we have the Galaxy Note5, the Galaxy S6 edge, iPhone 6, OnePlus 2, Sony Xperia M5, honor 7, HTC One E9+, Xiaomi Mi Note, Huawei P8 and the LG G4. The Galaxy S6 edge has an impressive camera and the new Note5 shouldn’t be far off. Following closely is the LG G4 which boast a similar 16MP sensor, faster f/1.8 lens and it comes assisted with Laser AF.  In terms of pixel count, the Sony Xperia M5, honor 7 and HTC One E9+ leads on paper with its 20MP+ sensor. Like everything we’ve seen in the past, a higher pixel count doesn’t necessary represent higher quality. The Xperia M5 and honor 7 looks promising as it uses Sony’s latest IMX230 sensor that has Phase Detection AF for faster focus. While we are at it, we’ve also thrown in the Xiaomi Mi Note, Huawei P8 and the OnePlus 2 that comes with a 13MP camera with OIS.  Of course, we can’t forget the iPhone 6. It might have the lowest pixel count at just 8MP but it is still impressive with its ease of use and snappy response.  We want you to pick the top 3 photos from each set. For example, here’s how you can rank the top 3 pictures in Set 1, from best to worst: I, E, C. Just so you know, the smart phones are randomised so each alphablet represents a different device in each set. Then the reader proceeds to rank sets 2 – 4.

Alexander Wong,Meet the 12.9″ iPad Pro. Apple’s answer to convergence devices,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/10/meet-the-12-9-ipad-pro-apples-answer-to-convergence-devices/,"apple ipad pro,Apple iPad Pro Launch,Convergence Devices,iOS,iOS 9,iPad,iPad Pro,iPad Pro Announcement,iPad Pro Malaysia,Tablet","iOS,iPad,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-10,"The   has revolutionised the way we consume content on a portable device. It started the whole tablet mania and it became the world’s   consumer product in history. For those needing to do some serious work on the go, the iPad still works but it isn’t as cut out as a real workhorse like the MacBook Air.  With  , the next big wave seems to be focused on convergence devices that blurs the line between tablet and PC like the  . And that’s where Apple is heading with its new iPad Pro that was announced today at San Francisco.  Designed as the ultimate media consumption and productivity tool, the iPad Pro is their largest tablet yet with a huge 12.9″ Retina Display that does 2732 x 2048 pixels resolution. This gives 78% more display area than its current iPad Air 2 and it pushes the same pixel density of 264 pixels per inch.  It is 6.9mm thick, the same thickness as the   but thicker than the iPad Air at 6.1mm. Being a bigger device, it is heavier as well at 713 grams for WiFi and 723 grams for the Cellular version. As comparison, the original iPad weighs in at 680 grams for WiFi and it goes as much as 730 grams for the 3G + WiFi model. Like the rest of the iPad range, the exterior design is typical iPad and it gets a TouchID enabled home button along with Silver, Gold and Space Grey colour options. What makes this a productivity beast is on the inside. With a newer iOS 9 out of the box, you get more multi-tasking features which include split screen along with more shortcuts to get things done quicker. The A9X 64-bit chip on-board is their most powerful mobile processor yet with almost twice the power of the A8X chip found on the iPad Air 2.  Setting the iPad Pro apart from the mainstream iPad is its new Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessory. Now this is starting to look like a Surface fighting device. The Smart Keyboard is sold separately as a US$169 option (about RM730) and doubles up as a smart cover with a keyboard built-in. It consists of 64 seamless keys that’s spill resistant.  The fabric microfiber of the cover is just 3.2mm thin while the keys pops up slightly at 4mm with its spring-like tension feedback. Attaching the Smart Keyboard onto the iPad is seamless which lets you snap on and use immediately without the need of wireless pairing. Unlike the Surface which has ridges on the sides, the iPad Pro connectors are flush with its 3 smart connector pins.  Steve Jobs used to poked fun at the stylus when the iPhone was introduced. For its new productivity product, they have finally introduced one as the Apple Pencil. This adds another freehand interaction which gives you the familiarity of a pencil.  Boasting a 240 times per second response time, drawing claims to be more real time with no noticeable lags and it recognises pressure from a gentle touch to thicker stroke lines. It even supports shading when drawn sideways, as if you’re drawing with a charcoal pencil. During the keynote, they have invited Microsoft and Adobe on stage to demonstrate the Pencil’s editing capability for both MS Office and Photoshop.  The Apple Pencil lasts 12 hours on a single charge which is juiced up with its lightning connector hidden underneath its silicon cap at the end. To charge it, you’ll need to plug it into the iPad Pro, which would probably look awkward if you’re carrying it while on the go. Thankfully it manages to rejuice an impressive 30 minutes of battery life from a mere 15 second charge. The Apple Pencil is sold separately at US$99 which is about RM427. One minor gripe is there’s no place for you to keep the Pencil on the iPad Pro and it doesn’t even come with a clip for you to hook it onto the case or a folder. Perhaps that might come as another optional accessory. So for the full productivity suite, the Smart Keyboard and   pencil will set you back close to RM1,200. Quite a substantial amount to pay compared to the  ‘s Type Cover Keyboard and Pen costing RM479 and RM189 respectively.  For video and music playback, the iPad Pro boasts 4 speakers with a pair of stereo speakers mounted on the top and bottom which rotates according to the orientation you’re in. For imaging, it gets the same 8MP f/2.4 main camera and a front facing 1.2MP HD Facetime unit as the iPad Air 2. Even with its bigger display and power processor, the iPad Pro still pushes its same 10 hour battery life on a single charge.  At this point, you probably know that the iPad Pro will not come cheap. This is going to be a very niche device like the 12.2″ Samsung Galaxy NotePro 12.2 and its higher end model is actually pricier than a full blown MacBook Air 11″ with 128GB at US$899 (RM3,391 Malaysian RRP). With the thinner MacBook around, the iPad Pro potentially could replace the MacBook Air completely. After all, you could run all your regular office and designing chores with iOS versions of MS Office and Photoshop.  The iPad Pro starts from US$799 (about RM3,462) for the 32GB WiFi model, while the larger 128GB unit is sold at US$949 (about RM4,112). For the all round connectivity with 4G LTE support, the 128GB WiFi + Cellular version is priced at US$1,079 (about RM4,700). The iPad Pro goes on sale in November just ahead of the Christmas shopping season. For more details, you can check out Apple’s   product page."

A newer Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update with the version number 10.7.A.0.222 is being rolled out to the first gen Xperia Z series. This covers the Xperia Z (C6602 and C6603), Xperia ZL (C6503 and C6506), Xperia ZR (C5503) and Xperia Tablet Z for both WiFi (SGP311, SGP312) and LTE (SGP321) models.  Although the version number is newer, it doesn’t seem to fix the   exploit. Hopefully this means there are more updates to come and it is good that Sony is still taking care of its ageing flagship devices. As usual, the updates should be pushed Over the Air (OTA), but to get it quicker we recommend you to check using the Sony PC Companion desktop app. From the looks of it, the Android 5.1.1 is being pushed to Xperia Z users before the Xperia Z1.

Meanwhile the rest of the older versions including Ice Cream Sandwich, Gingerbread and Froyo stands under 5%, which mostly should be retired by now.  While the upgrades from KitKat from Jelly Bean seems to be fast, the fact remains that most devices are still being left behind without much software updates. This is partly due to respective device makers that have ended software support for older models or are simply reluctant to make the switch to newer versions in favour of its own custom UI.

Having spent some time with the   in London, we’re looking forward how the Malaysian market reacts to this device, possibly outclassing the Huawei P8 in the process. The honor series has raised the bar since releasing their latest device in Europe, which boasts a metal chassis, a first for the honor lineup. Perhaps honor has taken a new turn, as they’ve announced during the release in UK that they want to reach out to the new generation. Capturing the youth is a daunting task but it gets easier if you have an affordable, yet great looking product. Recapping some specs, the honor 7 carries a 5.2-inch Full HD (1920 x1080) IPS-Neo display. Underneath the metal-clad body is a home-grown 64-bit Octa-core Kirin 935 processor, coupled with 3GB of RAM for zippy performance. Internationally, it gets 16GB of on-board storage, opposed to China’s huge 64GB step up option. Luckily there’s support for a microSD card up to 128GB for your expanded storage needs. Photo bugs will be pleased by the larger 20-megapixel sensor (f/2.0 aperture) that makes up the back of the device, along with its finger-print sensor module. On the front, selfies will be taken by an 8-megapixel shooter with soft flash. The lights will be kept on thanks to a 3,100 mAh battery that supports quick charge (0-50% in 30 minutes). A feature packed device that weighs in at 157 grams and 8.5mm thick. Operating system-wise it runs on EMUI 3.1 over Android 5.0 Lollipop. Malaysians love a bargain but there’s no info on the pricing as the vmall   leads to nothing (we checked), a bug that we hope the webmasters can sort out since many would be interested in this device. Its predecessor was launched at RM999 but the latest honor could see the price hover around RM 1,200 to RM 1,300, mainly dependent on how our currency continues to float on trading. We’re most probably going to hear something from the China based company soon regarding its pricing, as they usually do so before sales kick off.

A brave venture, considering that when the device will go on sale is still unknown; even crazier is the fact that Apple’s keynote only happens tomorrow. Pitching himself outside the extremely well-lit store located on George Street (the same store we visited to check out the  ), has so far spent a day on his fold-able chair and tent combo. His intentions are based on past instances of the Oceanic country being one of the first to have the latest Apple products in store. Handmer has taken this brief moment of fame to (shamelessly) plug his self-created online secondhand technology marketplace, mysparetech.com, since seeing that other individuals have done it prior during their own line-up adventures. Apple’s iPhones tend to hit shelves around the 18  of September, if they’re sticking to their existing habits, Handmer will be out in the 12-17 degree Celsius weather for quite some time. Apart of his marketing stunt, the Australian won’t be purchasing the device for himself, instead he intends to auction the device(s) off for a charitable cause –  , a startup that helps the homeless. He’s said that so far “it’s an up and down process” when asked about his experience so far going 24 hours in to the camp-out and had times where he questioned his decision to do so. The legality of it all is kind of up in the air, at least as far as Handmer is concerned, as the police officers he momentarily crossed paths with only pulled up to head into the nearby McDonald’s – at least for now. When more people join in the craze, he plans on keeping the atmosphere high by getting some party lights and music. It’ll be interesting to see how long he lasts out there but he’s fortunate enough to have a 24/7 McDonald’s and some gyms around the vicinity if he needs to get some food and freshen-up. Best of all, he’ll have some company during the weekend, when his fiance joins in. These occurrences are never bad for Apple but the employees at the Sydney store have some raised eyebrows at how the first potential person to purchase the latest iPhone uses a Dell laptop, together with a HTC phone. When asked about this, Handmer merely quipped that “Apple makes great products, but I guess I like the more technical stuff. Android, for those type of things.” and “I just tend to opt for the more affordable side of stuff.” If you’re interested to prepare yourself for a similar adventure, you can follow his journey on  .

Thanks to the circular bezel, it rotates to navigate – interaction with the screen without obstructing views on the 1.2-inch (360 x 360) screen. On the device, other than the rotating bezel navigation you’ll have a home button and a back button to help make your way around the OS. Tempting potential smart watch owners with two user focused designs: the quick detachable silicon band on the Gear S2 and the timeless 22mm leather band on the Gear S2 Classic – allowing buyers to choose based on their lifestyle preferences.

Utilising a 24-hour activity log, its functions include calendar, e-mail and news glances, as well as text notifications. For the first time ever, the Gear S2 will also come with an e-SIM option that runs on a 3G network. In-built with NFC, you’ll be able to use the function for mobile payment enabled terminals through Samsung Pay. Solving issues with home and car security, the Gear S2 is capable of connecting to smart homes and cars that use smart car keys.

A smart wearable that will cater to individualistic creature comforts of having a personalised device. Partnering with organisations will allow Samsung to offer a range of visual watch faces and watch bands, allowing you to fully customise your wearable to make it your own. Water resistant with a water and dust resistant IP68 rating across all variants, so the Gear S2 can be worn during any sweat earning activities and it’ll allow you to track your movements through its activity tracker (inclusive of an accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate sensor and so on).

They’ll also be equip with Wi-Fi: 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1 for the internet and pairing.

Setting the bar apart from last year’s version will be Moto Maker – quoting Motorola, you’ll be able to have 300 distinctive combinations of its customisation that ranges from watch case colour, watch bezel colour and the band. That too plus they’ve added the aforementioned 42mm watch face, to the original 46mm size for females and the guys who prefer a less clunky smart watch. Repositioning of the sole hardware button is also apparent, moving it from a 3 o’clock position to the now more practical 2 o’clock – supposedly to prevent scuffing while moving and flexing your wrist around.

The thickness of the models are all similar at 11.4mm but differ in battery sizes – 400 mAh (46mm); 300mAh (42mm). Differences on the Sport edition are basically it has an added GPS feature to track your runs and a non-removable 18mm rubber-like band, possibly appealing better to the more active folks. It’ll be a lot easier to view outdoors too, thanks to an AnyLight display that gels together a transmissive and reflective display. The entire line-up features a hot-swappable watch band that uses a distinctive locking mechanism; allowing you to choose from the list of watch band materials, whenever you need to – leather, silicon, leather and metal options. Motorola has kept some “flaws” with the infamous flat-tire making its way back again. The company claims that if you want smaller bezels, you’ll have to sacrifice this OCD-inducing pain black box-ish thing at the bottom of the display. Out of the box, it’ll run Android Wear 1.3 and be equipped with the existing gyroscope, optical heart rate monitor and ambient light sensor, though you’ll be able to have your watch on you if you’re taking a shower, thanks to the upgraded IP 68 rating. Price-wise, it’ll run you back $300 (RM 1,293) – $430 (RM 1,854), depending which personal combination of selections you put together when you pre-order your Moto 360 2  gen on Moto Maker.

Going as the Galaxy View, it made its brief appearance at the end of the Samsung livestream during IFA 2015, earlier in the day. Looking like a propped up Microsoft Surface with its own kick-stand, the Galaxy View left us asking more questions as Samsung only hinted with a couple of phrases for us to put together: “think bigger” and “a new dimension of entertainment”. Oh and they mentioned that more information about this huge “tablet” will be out come October. If the device’s screen does indeed come at an 18.4-inch size, we’re left mystified as to why earlier reports state that it’ll only pack a 1920 x 1080 display (works out to about 119 ppi), a lowly resolution for a screen that size. In terms of processing it packs a bigger punch – thanks to an assumed Exynos 7580 processor, together with 2GB of RAM.

Previously, its predecessor was considered to be LG’s answer to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 but this “ticker” display could possibly set it apart from other large phablets in the same category. This secondary screen could be used to display notifications and other information that would otherwise clutter the primary screen. Sharing a lot of qualities of the smaller G4, it seems to look the part as well – utilising the back-placed power buttons and volume rockers, as seen on the aforementioned smaller smart phone. Regarding the unannounced phablet’s power button, it looks like LG tweaked the design, making it rounder – could this redesign house a finger-print sensor for biometric security?

In addition, they’ve also added thermal regulating paste underneath the processing chip to further regulate its running temps. Not a lot of news has surfaced regarding how Sony’s latest offering handles multitasking, gaming and larger processing extensive tasks, so it seems like there’s a lot of real-world testing to be done. There’s yet to be news as when the device will reach our shores but you’ll be sure to read it here first."
Alexander Wong,Compared: Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ Malaysian Telco Pricing,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/04/samsung-malaysia-galaxy-note-5-s6-edge-plus-celcom-digi-maxis-umobile-comparison/,"Celcom,Comparison,DiGi,Dual Sim,Maxis,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Price,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus price,samsung malaysia,Telco Comparison,Telco Price Comparison,U Mobile","Android,Celcom,DiGi,Maxis,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,Samsung,U Mobile",2015-09-04,"Want to buy the latest   or   but not sure which telco plan is the right one for you? We’ve compared the current postpaid contract offers in Malaysia, to assist you with your purchase decision. Outright, the Galaxy Note5 is priced at RM2,699 and the S6 edge+ is at RM3,099, inclusive of 6% GST.  Buying one without a contract is probably the most convenient way to go but you could save some money with telco subsidies. At the moment, our 4 main telcos – Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile have started their contract bundle plans for the Galaxy Note 5, while the S6 edge+ is offered by everyone except U Mobile for now. Across the board, they are pretty much tied with 24 months duration with exception for Digi where it has a shorter 12 months option. As always, we recommend picking a plan based on your usage. So it is best to find out roughly how much data, calls and SMS you’ll need to avoid paying more than what you need. To calculate the cost of ownership of each plan, we add up the bundle price of the device together with the minimum subscription amount that you need to pay throughout the contract period. Below is the comparison chart which you can click for a larger view. 
On Celcom, there’s just 2 choices. A FIRST Basic Plan at RM85/month that optimises between 5GB of data, 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS or 2GB of data, 700 minutes of calls and 700 SMS. The next option of FIRST Elite comes with 2 SIM cards – one with up to 5GB of data, unlimited free calls/SMS and the 2nd SIM which gives you 3GB of data, 200 minutes of calls and 200 SMS. The amount of data and calls have been revised slightly with more data and calls than before. 
Digi offers the widest choice from as little as RM78/month up to RM238/month on its SmartPlan. To cater for different type of customers, each SmartPlan has an option of having more Voice or more Data. As part of their current promo, all plans from SmartPlan 78 and above will get additional 1GB of data for 6 months (not included in the comparison table above). For Digi, they still charge advance payment but it can be waived if you pay by credit card with its 0% interest EPP offer. All plans come with 24 months contract with exception for SmartPlan 78 that also comes with 12 months duration.  
In terms of plans, Maxis is offering the Galaxy Note5 and the S6 edge+ through its Zerolution programme which allows you to pay for your phone on a monthly installment without penalties and upfront payments. This however is only offered for its new MaxisONE Plans that come with unlimited calls and SMS starting at RM98/month. The bundled price is the same across all plans and the only difference is the amount of data you need on each month. While unlimited phone calls and SMS is perfect for those making lots of calls, it is quite expensive for those who require more data. It offers the least amount of data per buck compared to its rivals. For the highest MaxisONE Plan 188, they are offering 1GB additional data but it is only for the first 6 months.  For this comparison, we calculated based on the assumption that you will be keeping this device after 24 months. Therefore we are only considering the minimum monthly installment of RM93/month for the Note 5 and RM111/month for the S6 edge+, without the optional RM30/month early upgrade option and RM15/month device protection. If you look at the device price alone, the Galaxy Note 5 / S6 edge+ isn’t getting as much subsidy as the other telcos, but the benefit is that you have the freedom to stop at any time without penalty charges. Just pay the remainder balance of the installments and you’re done.  If you do plan to switch phones, the Zerolution RM30/month early upgrade option lets you do so after 12 months. So if the Galaxy Note 6 is out next year, you can just surrender the Note 5, and pay for the Note 6 installments for the next 12 months. Do note that you would need to return your old device in good condition, so it is recommended that you take up the RM15/month device protection offer.  
For now U Mobile is only offering the Galaxy Note 5 on contract and it is bundled with its Ultimate Device Plan that ranges between RM65/month to RM135/month. This is a more data centric plan with a couple of free calls thrown in.  Despite not having unlimited phone calls, the rates are the lowest across the range at only RM0.10/minute. If only U Mobile offered its   as on option, they would definitely unbeatable in value. Similar to Digi, there’s also an advance payment but it can be waived if you pay by credit card with auto debit enabled for future bills.  
Considering the long contract period you’re signing up for, you should look beyond the cheaper device price tag. Cost comparison is just half the picture and there are also other areas to look at such as the network quality and customer service. Most telco contracts do charge early termination fees so it is best to stick to a telco that would satisfy your needs for the next 2 years without worry.

Numbers which rose by 42% and 15%, in the two aforementioned categories, compared to the same half of 2014. Predominately, sales were geared towards makers from China and Taiwan for smartphones and the tablet space still leans towards global vendors. These numbers tell a different story, if you’ve been keeping tabs on the recent downward spiral of the Ringgit’s trading value, GST implementation and other of the country’s uncertainties. Seems like the rise in figures are tied to most mobile tech manufacturers adapting a wider ranger of devices that also cater to those looking for a more affordable option. Smartphones hovering around RM 500, pre-bundled with SIM plans and larger tablet slates going for less than RM 300, seemed to make a difference. Taking a look at who received the biggest slice of the pie, numbers by Apple and its Korean competitor Samsung fell opposed to past performances. When looking at the other makers from China and Taiwan, they’ve managed to scrap on by through maintaining their competitive stance on pricing and targeting the local market based on their needs. Nonetheless, Samsung still sits pretty at the top, with a huge majority of 40% – sales coming from their mid-rangers and lower-end models, the Galaxy J series and Galaxy V smartphone. Surprisingly, Samsung’s top of the line Galaxy S6 and S6 edge didn’t stir up a lot of figures. Other major players in the same league were, Asus (20%), Apple (15%), Lenovo (13%) and Huawei (12%). Asus had the ZenFone 5 and the Zenfone 2 to thank, keeping it as number two in an already competitive market segment. More premium in the eyes of the world, Apple held steadily in third position, while the last two let their more budget friendly options do the work: the A319 and A7000 for Lenovo and Huawei’s Honor series leading the way. Tablets, while still performed positively, didn’t have the same rapid adoptive rates, unlike smartphones. Fingers could be pointed that due to the devices costing more, buyers might reconsider purchasing as the larger screened devices don’t always boast a better spec sheet. In similar fashion, Samsung has the largest piece with 30% – sales mostly coming from the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0. The rest of the pie is shared by Lenovo, Apple, Asus and Acer; Lenovo shares the number two spot with Apple (27% each). Asus had about 13% driven by its 7-inch Fonepad 7, while Acer’s telco team-up, managed to get the Iconia Tab A1-713 rolling as well. Have you personally felt the pinch? Will you lengthen your product’s life and no longer upgrade as frequently as you previously did? Does it change how you’ll go about purchasing your mobile tech devices?

The screen apparently is so sensitive that it could weigh objects by placing them onto the display. They even   during the announcement event.

The front also gets a larger 8MP f/2.4 shooter and it is illuminated with a front mounted soft LED light.   When the Huawei P8 was launched, they introduced its Knuckle sense interaction, allowing you to take a screenshot by tapping with your knuckle. In reality, that was quite gimmicky and it robbed the P8 of its double tap to wake feature. On the Mate S, they have upgraded its knuckle technology to 2.0 which allows you to perform gesture controls like drawing C for camera using your knuckle. On top of that, the fingerprint scanner at the back also doubles up as a touch pad where you can use it for scrolling vertically or horizontally.  The Mate S also gets 3 microphones which allows recording for multi way conferencing, similar to the Note 4.

To refresh your memory, the Zerolution programme is a new way of owning a new smart phone and it comes with added device protection in a form of an insurance as well as the option to swap to a new phone after 12 months. There’s no hefty upfront payments and you can leave at any time without any penalty charges as long as you settle the remainder of your monthly installments in full. The Galaxy Note5 is offered at RM138/month while the Galaxy S6 edge+ can be yours at RM156/month.

If the device is returned in unacceptable conditions, a RM300 fee might apply when you make a swap. Even if you don’t plan to upgrade or need the extra device protection, the Galaxy Note5 effectively costs RM93/month, which in 24 months cost a total of RM2,232. That’s RM467 cheaper than the full retail price of RM2,699. The Galaxy S6 edge+ would effectively cost RM2,664 in the same calculation, which is a RM435 savings from its RM3,099 outright price.

Still running on a 2 flagships per year cycle with no signs of slowing down, the Xperia Z5 marks yet another evolution with some welcome upgrades.  The Xperia Z3+ or better known as the Xperia Z4 in Japan was seen as stop gap measure launching just months ahead of IFA 2015. Now the Xperia Z5 and its Z5 compact appears to be a more worthy replacement of its former Xperia Z3 series, launched exactly a year ago. In terms of design, the Xperia Z5 still looks familiar but there are some subtle tweaks to its appearance. The aluminium frame now gets a carved Xperia on the sides and the iconic power button has been replaced with an integrated fingerprint scanner. In the past Xperia Z series, the glass back is elegant to look at but it is also a huge fingerprint magnet. This time, Sony has opt for a frosted glass back, which aims to put an end to smudgy looking phones. Surprisingly the dimensions of the Xperia Z5 is identical with the Xperia Z3 at 7.3mm thick and it weighs slightly heavier at 154g (Xperia Z3: 152g). This makes the Xperia Z3+ the thinnest and lightest Xperia Z flagship at just 6.9mm and 144g respectively.  The front display is the same 5.2″ Full HD unit and under the hood it gets the same 64-bit Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board storage still stays at 32GB with expandable storage made possible with microSD up to 200GB. Like the  , the new 23MP sensor takes centre stage at the back, promising ultra-quick captures with its 0.03 second focus time. For selfies, it gets the same 5MP shooter as the Xperia Z3+ along with a wide angle 25mm lens. The battery on the other hand is slightly smaller than the Xperia Z3+ at 2,900mAh but Sony still reckons it maintains the same up to 2 days of battery life on a single charge.  In terms of colours, the Xperia Z5 comes in Graphite Black, Gold, White and Green. It is also available in either Single and Dual-SIM variants, supporting 4G LTE.  Offering a flagship experience without the bulk, the Xperia Z5 Compact comes with a smaller 4.6″ display that does HD 720p (1280×720) resolution. It shares the same Snapdragon 810 processor as the bigger Z5 brother but it comes mated with just 2GB of RAM. Storage remains unchanged at 32GB and it also gets the same 23MP main and 5MP front cameras. Keeping the lights on is a 2,700mAh capacity battery that’s rated to last up to 2 days.  Being a more youthful device, the Z5 Compact comes in Graphite Black, White, Yellow and Coral colours. Overall, it is slightly thicker at 8.9mm but it weighs a much lighter 138 grams. Both the Xperia Z5 and Xperia Z5 Compact runs on the latest Android 5.1 Lollipop and both are expected to go on sale internationally from October 2015 on wards.

Arif Lee,Barcelona FC and OPPO team-up could mean a football themed R7 Plus,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/02/barcelona-fc-and-oppo-team-up-could-mean-a-football-themed-r7-plus/,"Android,Barcelona FC,Dual Sim,Oppo,OPPO Barcelona,Oppo Malaysia,oppo R7 plus,OPPO R7 Plus Barcelona,OPPO R7 Plus Malaysia,smart phone","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo,Rumour Mill",2015-09-02,"Officially partnering with each other since June, OPPO has seen the success and brand awareness that its competitors have attempted with other well-known footballing clubs, leading it to its first attempt at a branding collaboration. Posts on the Chinese company’s official Weibo account announces a special event that’s to be held on the 8  of September, possibly announcing the Barcelona  . Publications in China have been going off since the photo emerged with the Barcelona team pictured and the text “it’s my turn”. The R7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition is purported to match the original R7 Plus, when considering hardware – though it’ll have some sort of Barcelona emblem on the back and pre-installed themes associated with the Catalan club. Recapping some specs of the R7 Plus, it features a huge 6-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) AMOLED display and runs the 64-bit Octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor. Memory on the device sits at 3GB of RAM and for internal storage, you’ll get 32GBs (expandable to an extra 128GB via microSD card). If you make use of the aforementioned expandable storage, you’ll utilise the second SIM tray slot on this Dual-SIM 4G LTE enabled phablet. This thin smart phone measures at only 7.75mm thickness but packs a huge 4100 mAh battery that supports VOOC Flash Charging (75% in 30 minutes). The R7 Plus runs a 13-megapixel Sony sensor, which is readily equip with Phase Detection auto-focus and dual-tone LED flash; donning the front is a decent 8-megapixel selfie camera that provides ample amount of pixels to produce selfies. It’ll also feature a finger print sensor on its back under the mentioned camera module. Software is supported by version 2.1 of ColorOS, based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. Initially priced (in July) at RM 1,998 in Malaysia, we’re unsure that with the current specs, OPPO will still be able to market this Barcelona edition at the same price. No mention of pricing has cropped up yet for the Barcelona version but news floating around goes to say that the shipped unit will feature a packaging and accessories carrying the Barcelona name, leaving us to believe it’ll be a true representation of the La Liga giants. Would we see this device sold globally? Most probably, as it’d be foolish for OPPO not to take advantage of the global presence the football club carries. Are die-hard Barcelona fans willing to drop a chunk on the purported device? You tell us."

Outed as the void-filler in between the One M9 and its yet to be released successor, it looks pretty much like an iPhone if viewed from the back. The official HTC Weibo post states that we will be able to take a look at the device on the 6  of September, leaving us to only 4 days before we’ll see the latest HTC smart phone. Since the image’s text was posted in Mandarin, many are still unsure of its meaning – even after getting help from Google translate, which struggled to translate it to English. Supposedly, the text goes to say something along the lines of “the strength to fight bias” and “simple colour value”. Not giving away much, by any means, however, it’ll be a tough climb for the Taiwanese company, if the device they’re releasing doesn’t offer any visual distinction from its competitors (provided the Aero looks like how it does in the   leaks) Internally, that might differ, as the new HTC A9 is touted to be powered by an industry’s first tri-cluster Deca-core (10) MediaTek Helio X20 and a Mali-T880 MP4 graphics processor. It’ll also apparently carry a QHD display with Gorilla Glass 4, protecting it from any unwanted scratches and smudges. Notorious leaker @evleaks posted that this new flagship might carry the “One” title, with the HTC One A9 (Aero) but we’ll wait to see if September the 6 confirms his speculation. The late rise of Samsung in the Android market, brought the demise of the HTC name, so we hope in earnest that their new handsome hero can bring back some good news for the company."

Flash-forward to the last day, which allowed us to see the new Zenfone 2 Deluxe and the Zenfone 2 Laser. As the name implies, the 2 Laser has a 13-megapixel shutter on the rear, that’s equip with laser auto-focus and dual-LED to boost its camera taking ability. Seems like ASUS wants put its Zenfone devices in smaller niche categories by making them differ in small aspects. However, we aren’t sure this is a great strategy to begin with. Nevertheless, the determining factor that sets the Zenfone 2 Laser apart from the Zenfone Selfie, is omission of the 13-megapixel sensor on the selfie camera, no dual-LED up front and tuning the internal specs a tad lower. It’s quite unfortunate that Malaysia will be getting only the mid-range model from the list of three Zenfone 2 Laser devices released. The Zenfone 2 Laser has an entry level 64-bit capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 410, coupled with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Although, being a slouch in the processing department, the device is no slouch in the cellular connectivity department – LTE enabled dual-SIM support. Sporting a 5.5-inch display with only 720 p resolution, the smart phone is powered by a large 3000 mAh battery and runs on a ZenUI skinned version of Android 5.0 out of the box. Upping the stakes on its current Zenfone 2 series, ASUS also announced pricing of the Zenfone 2 Deluxe. An upscale model that redesigns the back to look like intricate polygons scales, purported to increase the grip of the device. That aside, ASUS also decided to maintain the Intel Atom Z3580 to 2.3GHz but double the internal storage to 128GB. Once you’ve considered the two, otherwise, the Zenfone 2 Deluxe is pretty much the same as the high-end Zenfone 2 (ZE551ML) model. Packing 4GB of RAM and even a microSD slot for additional storage (up to 128GB), given that you’ve stuck out on your already existing 128GB of internal memory. It’ll also run the 5.5-inch IPS screen at FHD (1920 x 1080), that’s present on the ZE551ML. ASUS’s latest premium device supports 4G LTE on its Dual-SIM capable phone that has a 3000 mAh battery (fast charge enabled). Lastly, it runs the same ZenUI skinned Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system."

Alarms are going off on the Interwebs as Huawei’s continuation of premium metal-clad design and evolution of mobile technology are to include a purported big hardware upgrade on the Huawei MateS. Apparently, the device’s screen will take a hit, shrinking it from the original Mate 7 (6-inch) to 5.7-inches, proving it to be a more one-handed friendly device. Based on leaks, we’ll likely see a better screen-to-body ratio that will help the aforementioned problem. Supposedly carrying a 1920 x 1080 resolution screen, this Huawei phablet is said to have the Kirin 935 processor on board, mated with 3GB of RAM. The device has been rumoured to feature a 20-megapixel rear camera, most probably a Sony IMX 230 module, an 8-megapixel front facing camera and a fingerprint reader as well. Sounds to be an exciting product so far but we’ve kept the best for last – it’ll “likely” have Force Touch on its large 5.7-inch display. Innovation in the area, could see better interaction with our devices, and beating Apple to their own punch (as the iPhone 6s is also rumoured to have this technology on its Retina display). Based on what we’re hearing so far about the MateS, it seems like the Honor 7 and the former share cues in the respective departments: processor, RAM, camera module and finger-print sensor. IFA 2015, in Berlin will be the place to be if you want to know more about this phablet from Huawei. Though, their tweet seems to confirm that the MateS will have Force Touch, Apple still might have a head start, even though they’re set to announce a week later – seeing that they’ve dabbled in Force Touch technology before in their MacBooks and Apple Watches."

It packs a 4K display at the front which is basically 3840×2160 pixels crammed into a 5.5″ screen, giving an insane pixel density of 806 pixels per inch. If you can’t imagine how big a deal this is, it is like squeezing 4x Full HD displays into a single smart phone.  This a huge leap not only for Sony but also for the smart phone industry where most players are still reluctant to jump onto the Quad HD bandwagon due to power and cost practicality. With a display allowing you to watch 4K content in its intended resolution, the Xperia Z5 Premium also gets a newer 23MP 1/2.3″ Exmor RS sensor with a f/2.0 lens. This is a fully upgraded camera since the Xperia Z1 that came with a 20.7MP shooter until its recent Xperia Z3+. It records 4K videos and despite having no Optical Image Stabilisation, the Inteligent Active Steady Shot technology helps to remove unintended shakes from your footages. With a Hybrid AutoFocus system that first featured on the Xperia M5, you can capture moments quicker with its 0.03 second focus time.

Under the hood, it gets the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor as the rest of the Xperia Z5 series and it is mated to 3GB of RAM along with 32GB of on-board storage. Being a 4K consuming and creating device, it allows storage expansion with microSD up to 200GB.  In the audio department, the Xperia Z5 Premium has no compromises with its High-Res Audio support, DSEE HX upscaling and built-in Digital Noise Cancellation. For better audio playback, it gets an S-Force Front Surround speakers and it also records audio in stereo format.  Even with such a high resolution display, the Xperia Z5 Premium still maintain’s Sony’s phenomenal up to 2 days of battery life thanks to a much larger 3,430mAh capacity battery. The long battery life is achieved with a built-in memory on the display which cuts down processor utilisation when the screen isn’t refreshed. To juice up faster, it supports QuickCharge 2.0 that could give you 5.5 hours of use with just a 10 minute charge.  In terms of design, it is slightly thicker at 7.8mm and it weighs 180 grams. On the right side, the iconic physical power button has been replaced with a capacitive unit which doubles up as a one touch fingerprint scanner. To live up to its Premium name, the device comes with a stainless steel frame and it comes with a mirror finish Black, Gold and Chrome colours. As always, the Xperia Z5 Premium is also water and dust resistant with a capless micro USB charging port with IP68 rating.

This time it will be released in 3 sizes – a Z5 Compact, a mid-sized Z5 and a larger Z5 Premium version. Thanks to a  , we now have a clearer look at the new Xperia flagships ahead of its official announcement.  In terms of design, the overall shape hasn’t change since the early Z series with its omni-balance approach of having a flat slab with subtle rounded corners. Gone is the iconic chrome power button and it is replaced by a wider flat looking one which potentially could double up as a fingerprint scanner. The frame has a poly-carbonate looking material with matte finish, while the premium version seems to have a glossy look to it. We are not sure if the devices shown here is a final product but it looks more sturdy than the previous version. Retained also is the standard volume rocker and dedicated camera button, and the micro USB port is exposed just like its newer waterproof devices. On the left side, all 3 models has the word Xperia written and it still gets a flap cover which potentially still houses both Nano-SIM and microSD expansion. The back hasn’t changed since the beginning of the Xperia Z series and it is shown to carry a 23MP 1/2.3″ sensor, which is an upgrade over its current 20.7MP shooter on the Xperia Z1, Z2, Z3 and Z3+.  In terms of specs, the Xperia Z5 Compact will get a 4.6″ HD 720p display, while the Xperia Z5 retains the similar sized 5.2″ Full HD display. For the Xperia Z5 Premium, it is said to be a larger 5.5″ screen that pushes a   4K display at 3840×2160. According to leaked  , both Xperia Z5 Compact and Xperia Z5 will be running on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 processor and it gets 3GB RAM for the Z5 and just 2GB RAM for the Z5 Compact. In terms of storage, the benchmarks suggest 32GB on-board for both models. They are also expected to receive a 23MP main and a front facing 5MP camera. Strangely the front camera is a notch below its current Xperia M5 and Xperia C5 Ultra that comes with a 13MP front shooter.  So far there isn’t any indication on the Z5 Premium specs but it is likely to carry better specs with 4GB RAM being a possibility. The Xperia Z5 is expected to be announced early tomorrow morning and we will find out the full specs by then. Do you like what you see? Or did you prefer if Sony went bonkers with an all new design?"

That’s the name of the game with these online driven brands. Before the rise of Xiaomi in international markets, Huawei claims to be in the forefront of e-commerce with its honor smart phone line up. Although both Huawei and honor share the same roots, they are distinctively different in terms of positioning and for us consumers, the price tag makes a whole world of difference. During today’s event, “honor” was emphasised as a brand for the new generation and for those who are young at heart. Being a digital-native driven product, it goes directly to consumers, cutting out the middle man which results lower cost and a more competitive price tag. Last year, the honor 6 stood out as one of our favourite 4G LTE smart phones under RM1,000. With its in-house developed Kirin processor, it performed just as good as a flagship Galaxy S5 and yet it cost half the price of other similar flagship devices. For 2015, the new honor flagship isn’t just an improvement but it aims to move the goal post further. The honor 7 gets a slightly bigger 5.2” Full HD display encased in an all metal unibody design. It feels much better than the honor 6 which felt plasticky. The front looks virtually the same as the honor 6 but you’ll notice the changes as you turn to the sides.  The back has a nice curve which makes it comfortable to hold, while the top and bottom ends have a plastic cover with some nice texture to it. You’ll find a large camera lens which protrudes slightly but you need not to worry about scratches as it uses sapphire glass. Also prominent is a new fingerprint scanner that’s quite similar to the Ascend Mate 7.  On the right, you’ll find your usual power and volume rockers, while the left houses a SIM tray slot and a new Smart Key. At the top, it is no surprise with a typical headphone jack, a secondary mic as well as an infrared blaster."

The mobile device maker has also thrown in a special 50% off on any second purchase of a Galaxy Note5 but you’ve gotta be the first 100 in line for the Sunway Pyramid roadshow and the first 50 for both the Penang and Johor launch – making only 200 individuals lucky enough to snap up the Note5 at half its RRP of RM2,699.

Other than that, it’ll have 32GB of internal storage; unfortunately, there will be no MicroSD slot on the Note5 that weights in at a mere 171g. Images are captured better thanks to a 16-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel front-facing snapper – both sensors have an f/1.9 aperture, making low light shots a better experience. Samsung also decided to omit the hot-swappable battery, which stands at 3,000 mAh. With omissions, there are definitely new inclusions, as the device now supports Dual-SIM LTE slots. You’ll see the same specs on the Galaxy S6 edge+ too but it’ll differ in two aspects – the captivating dual edged display and no S Pen on board. Its definitely meant to be more of a screen upgrade from the original 5.1-inch Galaxy S6 edge and improve its rigidity by upping the aluminum to a 7000 series. Existing Note users won’t be left out either, as Samsung has let them upgrade through their   program. Below you’ll find the listing of value matched to the corresponding models. Still feeling unsure of buying a phablet? You’re in luck, cause Samsung also dropped the prices for the smaller Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, for the duration of the roadshow.

Arif Lee,Here’s what happens when your S Pen gets stuck,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/28/heres-what-happens-when-your-samsung-galaxy-note-5-s-pen-gets-stuck/,"Android,Galaxy,note 5,S Pen backwards,S Pen slide-gate,S Pen slidegate,S Pen stuck,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note,samsung galaxy note 5,samsung Galaxy Note 5 launch,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy note 5 Photos,Samsung Galaxy Note5,Samsung Unpacked 2015,Slide-gate,Slidegate,smart phone","Android,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-28,"Yesterday we addressed the big ruckus that’s been going around regarding the  ‘s S Pen “design flaw” – we use that phrase loosely, as the Korean manufacturers realised the problem but it was probably too late to rectify the problem, due to it being too late in the process. So does printing a disclaimer save them from the backlash? As far as we’re concerned, when you fork out RM 2,699 for a phablet, you’re expecting something that has stood up to vigorous testing. How far along were they before they finally realised? Was putting up that 25  page in the user manual adequate? What actually causes the S Pen functionality to go bust? We aren’t entirely sure about the first two questions but we’ll help answer the third in this article. Blessed to have the guys from   and   who’ve dived into this whole mess by showing what it looks like on the inside of the Note5 when the S Pen inserted the wrong way. Looking closer at the photo, you’ll see levers that jut out in the silo: one controls S Pen detection and functionality, while the other secures the stylus from falling out the silo. The former/lever 1 sits in between the middle and the end of the silo, under the primary logic board angled upwards on the right of the S Pen; without this lever, you’ll lose two features – Screen-off memo and Air Command. However, lever 1 doesn’t cause the S Pen to get stuck – that’s caused by lever 2. Located a little further up the silo, towards the end is the lever that will be the doom of your stylus. An intricate writing tool of sorts, it’s designed to have two small cutouts near the writing end that holds it in firmly when slotted correctly, writing tip first. A positive design but here’s the deal – if it’s placed backwards or click side first, you’ll see it getting hitched after passing the second lever. Once you’re in this deep, you’re probably not getting it out, considering the lack of space following this mishap. If you’re lucky enough to get the backward S Pen passed the second lever, you’re gonna have to get past the first lever again. Removing the Samsung stylus after this could likely damage the other plastic lever that’s mounted inside an internal part soldered to the main board. Thin in nature, this plastic lever gives you the S Pen detection capability, thus making you disable S Pen Detection to get the stylus to work (that is if you’ve managed to get it out in the first place) – killing the two aforementioned features, delivering a bleak Note5 writing experience. Sympathising with current and future owners of the Galaxy Note5, all we can do is advise everyone to avoid this scenario (as unrealistic as it is) and don’t try to replicate this problem at all, you’ll regret even trying to do so. We’ve yet to see if Samsung will buckle from the feedback, probably offering some sort of replacement program, or have a software alert when the silo detects backwards insertion.

We’re likely to see the internal upgrades of the  and the  , coming from the Cupertino natives. Subsequently, there’s a possibility that a fresh iPad and Apple TV might make an appearance during the event. Apple’s take on an iOS 9, OS X El Capitan and watchOS 2 are also stated to be released during the time. Word floating around goes to say that the displays on the new iPhones will sport the innovative Force Touch function. If you’ve haven’t heard of Force Touch, it’s basically a pressure-sensitive technology that enables users to access extended functions – that’s been available on the Apple Watch and their latest line of MacBooks. Do we think it’s absolutely necessary to have Force Touch on board? It’ll be negligible at best, with increased accessibility to functions; widgets, maybe? Nonetheless, Apple’s “innovation” has always been “revolutionary” like Siri (which people ended up forgetting about), so we’ll see if there’s anything to shout about while having this feature incorporated in the Retina Display of the new iPhones. Other hardware upgrades should also bring about 2GB of RAM, a new A9 processor chip, and a camera optics bump to 12-megapixels. In recent times, Apple has gradually slowed its ability to innovate, or at least innovate something that’s game-changing. A worrying trend that’s been faced by other manufacturers, as well. That aside, iOS 9’s features, has already been previewed in June and it’ll come in just a 1.3 GB package. This is a great improvement since iOS 8 required at least 5GB’s to unpack. A little late to the party, but the new OS will allow users to take advantage of iDevices with larger displays through multi-window. Other nifty improvements can be seen  . Fortunately, Chinese tech site cnBeta gives us something to look at (since the device will look the same) with the purported packaging images. What you’re looking at is a stupendously pretty Butterfly Koi image on the said device. Rumours say that this image could be the similar motion wallpaper previously available for the Apple Watch.

The   is a perfect example of a functional smart watch but for some, it is still too much to pay for a digital accessory. At the   global launch in London, they have   the availability of its new honor band that could bring smart watches to the masses with its affordable price tag.  The design of the honor band is simple. A round OLED display that’s surrounded by a metal frame without any use of buttons.

However essentially this like having a   underneath and it tracks your steps, sleep, display alerts and you can find out who’s calling you while your phone is in your pocket.

If you’re wondering if you could take this for a swim, you would be pleased to know that it has IP68 water and dust resistance which they say is capable of being submerged under 10 metres of water for up to 30 minutes. In terms of battery life, the honor band does up to 3 days on a single charge. There isn’t much details on the full specs including the display resolution and battery size, and we are told that these units aren’t final for full commercial release.  There are 3 colours available – Black, White and Khaki. For the European market, the band will be available sometime in Q4 2015 and it carries a price tag of 79 Euros or 59 GBP. That’s approximately RM370-RM380 in our current exchange rate. There’s no info on Malaysian availability just yet but we are told to stay tuned for future local announcements. If you’re just looking for something basic, the honor band could be your cup of tea. For those wanting more with a longer battery life, you could top up around RM50 extra and go for a Pebble smart watch that’s currently priced at US$99 (about RM415).

Adding to an existing slew of addware, the Zenfone Selfie has ZenMotion – a feature that lets you draw an “S” on the screen to open the front facing camera to snap your selfies. As more Zenfone models become a norm, it’ll be harder to differentiate their devices – at least in terms of aesthetics. Similarly, the Zenfone Selfie looks much alike the Zenfone 2, on the surface for the most part.

Offering the two visually different models to a different crowd – Gear S2 towards the sportier, always running about user, while the classic version will be for individuals who much rather have a timeless watch face design. The former will be attached to the silicon band, available in either a dark grey case + black band or a silver case + white band combination. Then we’ll see a black case donning the leather black band, on the Gear S2 classic. All three variants share the latest Tizen OS, seen on previous iterations of Samsung wearables, with only the inception of the rotating bezel screen changing the game for the Korean outfit.

All three models come in the same 11.4mm but differ slightly in dimensions and battery size. The regular Samsung Gear S2 measures at 42.3 x 49.8 x 11.4mm at 47 grams, while the classic model is slimmed down to reflect a more elegant look – 39.9 x 43.6 x 11.4mm at 42 grams. They both share a 250mAh battery, supposedly will last up to 2-3 days of normal use.

There’s no pricing yet but we’ll see that during IFA in Berlin. So does it make sense to pick up a wearable like this?

Ideally, it’s a two way street when concerning this issue, as Samsung could have probably designed the stylus in a way that it can’t possibly slide in backwards by accident. So let’s not try anything funny here, folks – cause Samsung isn’t gonna replace your stylus and the sensors inside the silo (at least not for free). If you’re worried about how the Galaxy Note5 will hold up to stress and drops do watch the video below (skip to 7:45 in the video to see how the Note5 fared)"

Almost a year after the release of its   in Malaysia, the new successor steps up with a premium build and enhanced features to close the gap with its flagship rivals. For those who are unfamiliar, Honor is Huawei’s sub-brand that’s digitally driven through its Vmall online stores. In China, the honor 7 did tremendously well with 200,000 sold online in just 2 minutes.  To recap, the honor 7 is slightly larger at 5.2 inches and the IPS-Neo display pushes a Full HD resolution of 1920×1080. Under the hood is an updated 64-bit Octa-Core (4X 1.5GHz + 4X 2.2GHz) Kirin 935 processor that’s mated with 3GB of RAM. For the international market, it gets 16GB of on-board storage which can be expanded with microSD up to 128GB. The overall build of the honor 7 is pretty solid with its unibody metal back that comes with a slight curve for a more comfortable grip. On the right, it gets a power button in the middle and a volume rocker right next to it. On the left side, you’ll find a Smart Key button which can be customised to your reference and a SIM tray slot that supports dual-SIMs.  The main speaker and microphones are placed at the bottom alongside its microUSB port, while the top comes with the standard headphone jack and an infrared blaster.   For photography, the honor 7 gets a much larger 20MP IMX230 sensor from Sony and a f/2.0 aperture lens. The new sensor comes with Phase Detection Auto Focus which provides an ultra-quick focusing time of 0.1 seconds. While the camera lens has a protruding bump, it uses sapphire glass to protect it from scratches. In terms of features, it supports a wide range of filters, slow-mo, time lapse and even light painting, a key feature that was introduced with the   flagship. At the front, it gets an 8MP f/2.4 shooter with soft flash. Over at the back, the honor 7 also gets a fingerprint scanner which unlocks instantly on a single touch. Like the Huawei P8, it also supports knuckle sense, allowing you to double tap using your knuckle to take a screenshot but at the same time, it still supports the standard double tap to wake while the screen is switched off.  Keeping the lights on is an embedded 3,100mAh battery and it also support quick charge which does 0-50% in 30 minutes. Overall the honor 7 weighs 157 grams and has a thickness of 8.5mm. Out of the box, it runs on EMUI 3.1 that’s based on Android 5.0 Lollipop.  The honor 7 is expected to come to Malaysia officially in September. In China, the dual-SIM 4G LTE variant with 16GB is   at 2,199CNY which is about RM1,436. Meanwhile in the UK where the device is being launched, the honor 7 is priced at £249.99 (about RM1,611).

The returns were minimal, although achieving sales through the high end Moto X, and lower end Moto G and Moto E. Lenovo decided that their portfolio was better suited if they capitalised on buying Moto’s presence in the Western market, giving them a better chance worldwide. Almost a year on, they’ve now decided to sell solely under the Motorola name, dissolving its Lenovo Mobile branding. A merging will see all future phones to be sold under the Motorola name, solving the problem of managing two separate companies, who sell the same type of product. In theory, both companies gain as Motorola has always had an issue with only having a limited model inventory, at least presently. Lenovo tops out in terms of its marketability, for the markets they’re not well known yet. All of this is speculation, for the most part – as no official English press release has been outed. So what happens to the latest Lenovo Vibe Shot and the Lenovo Vibe S1? It’ll likely be Lenovo’s last offerings, to match Motorola’s conspicuous design or could we see a more varied aesthetic language from the future Motorola devices? Back to the lack of worldwide mention on the subject; based on the lack of information coming from Lenovo, instead only coming from Xiaomi Times – we hope all customers take this information with a grain of salt. So who knows what the future holds for both Lenovo Mobile and Motorola Mobility? Tell us what you think in the comments below."
Arif Lee,First solid rollable keyboard comes to life: the LG Rolly,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/28/first-solid-rollable-keyboard-comes-to-life-the-lg-rolly/,"LG,LG Rolly Keyboard,portable keyboard,Rolly Keyboard","Cool stuff,LG,Mobile Accessories,Others",2015-08-28,"Announced as the “industry’s first solid rollable wireless portable keyboard”, the   Rolly is made for people on their tablets and smartphones who need to type out a wordy document or quickly reply to conversations on instant messaging apps. We’ve seen a lot of flexible keyboards in the past but being made out of silicon, they were flimsy at best. The LG Rolly keyboard tackles that by existing in an “impact-resistant” polycarbonate with ABS plastic – potentially increasing the experience of the tactile feedback. Roll it/fold it and turn it into a slim cuboid shape to carry around, increasing portability without sacrificing too much on the typing feedback. It’ll connect to your favoured device through Bluetooth 3.0 and can be paired to two devices at the same time and has an in-built stand (limited to tablets not more than 10 inches). LG probably took some cues from  , which has the same two previously mentioned features but loses out to the Logitech’s ability to switch between 3 devices, not just 2. Though, you’re likely to prefer the rollability of the LG Rolly more, if it’ll be joining you on the daily. For a device powered by a single AAA battery, it’ll provide enough juice to last you 3 months – as quoted by LG. Scheduled to make an appearance during IFA 2015 in September, we’re hoping to see this thing in action and if it’s all it’s made to be. There’s no word on pricing and availability for now but you’d probably find out early next month."

If you’ve purchased the said device and its serial number falls within the range that was affected, Apple will replace your iSight camera on the iPhone 6 Plus for free. Those eligible have to ensure they meet two prerequisites: their device matches the range of serial numbers and your phone is taking blurry shots with its rear camera. Here’s how to find your iPhone 6 Plus’ serial number for Apple’s iSight Replacement Program: After finding out your serial number through the method above, head on over   and simply key in your serial number to check if it’s eligible. Once you’ve checked its eligibility, you can drop off your problematic iPhone at any participating  . They’ll verify your eligibility and examine if your device is in working order. Below are some locations in Kuala Lumpur where you can drop your iPhone 6 Plus. Before you pass your smart phone over to anyone, make sure you   on iTunes or iCloud to make sure there’s no data lost during the repair; do consider wiping your device clean after backing up your infomation to avoid any embarrassing photo scandals and protect any sensitive data – don’t worry, you’ll be able to restore everything from the data back up that you did earlier once you get your repaired iDevice back. Apple also hands a wary disclaimer, saying that if any components are damaged prior that might impair camera replacement, it’ll have to be resolved first before they can continue; some cases there will be cost incurred, given another component is preventing camera replacement (e.g. cracked screen) Worth mentioning that Apple might ask you to get your iPhone 6 Plus repaired by its country of origin; the replacement program doesn’t extend the warranty coverage of your iPhone. Be sure to get your device fixed quickly, if it’s eligible, as the program duration only last for 3 years after the first retail unit was sold (September 2014). In the past, Apple has faced qualms with its iPhone 5’s   and  , proving that even with high industry standards, premium products and all that jazz, you’re just as likely to produce products with faults.

Lots of pixels, power and multitasking that comes together with 32GB internal memory, that is expandable with a MicroSD card.

The same goes for the MicroSD slot, that used to live on the Note 4 and its predecessors but has been omitted from the newest Note5. Don’t be too disappointed though, as you’ll be pleased to know that the LTE capable device now has Dual-SIM support on board, allowing dual-wielding phone users to minimise the number of phones they need to carry. The other star of the show, is the Galaxy S6 edge+, and while it only differs in terms of the availability of the S Pen, the dual edged display and its aesthetic value, has the same specs as the Note5. Succeeding its smaller sibling in a big way, the 5.7-inch screen is larger to increase visibility, and improve its hardiness, with a tougher 7000 series aluminium – stronger than the S6 edge."
Arif Lee,You MUST fund this project,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/21/fotokite-phi/,"camera,Drone,Drone journalism,Fotokite,Fotokite Phi,Fotokite Pro,GoPro,hybrid drone,indiegogo,Surveillance","Cool stuff,Kickstarter,Others",2015-08-21,"Tethered on a retractable leash similar to those used with dogs, it solves the problem of your quadcopter going rogue. The Phi aim is to simplify drone flying and make it easy for the average consumer to use with minimal training required. Extending up to 26 feet and having the ability to attach a GoPro to the kite-drone, one can only imagine the possibilities of aerial photography. Being funded through the crowd-funding platform, Indiegogo, the Phi (drone only, no GoPro) is available for pre-order for $249 USD / RM 1027 (now $289 USD / RM 1191) and will ship sometime in Q1 2016. Not a stranger to the drone world, Fotokite previously developed and launched the Fotokite Pro, that has made itself a regular in news organisations like the BBC. Handing tools to potential citizen journalists around the world, the Fotokite Phi is set to enable access to harmful protests zones or provide a less worrisome experience in a large open spaced area. Flight is propelled by 4 low-torqued plastic blades shielded by guards to decrease chances of injury, if one were to come in contact with the flying robot. The aforementioned inspiration behind the creation of the Fotokite was Lupashin’s observations during protests stemming, due to the suspicious federal election that took place in Russia back in 2011. Thankfully, some of these occurrences were captured by drone photographers who were in the area, which gave us a good look at how the Russian people were reacting. Hence, it proved that drone journalism would be pivotal but the only obstacle would be the necessary knowledge to fly a drone in crowded areas – that’s where the innovative leash system would come in. Making use of the same technology in retractable dog leashes, Lupashin excluding the need of a well-versed drone pilot. Tethered in such a manner whereby the leash line sits just below the provided GoPro slot, it’ll ensure that the lens always stays pointed towards the individual manning the drone. Weighing only 12 ounces / 341 grams (including the battery and camera) the Fotokite Phi can fold itself to maximise space and is kept away in its packing tube. Twist gestures command the device to start-up and turning min-flight is manipulated by a button click and similar flick of the wrist, while the leash can be slacked to provide a wider viewing area for stills and video. If you’re in the market for something a little higher end, you can look at the Fotokite Pro – mainly the same as its more affordable sibling (15 minutes fly-time) except for the tether doubling as a power cable and a downlink transfer for uncompressed HD video, providing longer recording and flight-times. Do check out their   and their page   if you want to get your hands on this amazing drone."

Utilisation of this feature omits the need for a front camera and allows a higher pixel resolution quality of the regular pictures you’d normally use your front-facing smart phone snapper for. Apparently build with hardiness in mind, the camera module is said to be able to withstand 132 flips a day, for two years. A bold proclamation for the number two Chinese smart phone maker. The camera sensor itself will be a Sony 13-megapixel BSI sensor with a f/2.0 aperture lens.   Notwithstanding its regular smart phone features, the Honor 7i also comes with a fingerprint sensor, placed at its side. Claiming to be the smallest said sensor on any phone, the Honor 7i embraces cues from the   – this same fingerprint sensor can also allow you to take photos using your thumb on the Honor 7i.

It’ll come with Huawei’s EMUI 3.1 out of the box and be powered by a 3000 mAh battery. The Honor brand will soon release and market the Honor 7 internationally, so this could mean the same applies for the Honor 7i in the near future, however grey importers should find no trouble in bringing in the new phone, as they normally do.

The   which is their thinnest smart phone at a mere 4.85mm has returned for a sequel in the form of the OPPO R5s. Nothing has changed in terms of design but it gets a new grey colour scheme that looks pretty slick. Under the hood, it gets some welcomed upgrades – a larger 3GB RAM and 32GB of on-board storage. As comparison, the current OPPO R5 has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Like the original R5, storage isn’t expandable with microSD.   The rest of the spec-sheet is the same as before with a 5.2″ Super AMOLED display that does full HD 1080p and it runs on an Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor. Unfortunately the embedded battery is the same paltry 2,000mAh unit but it can be replenished quickly with VOOC Flash charger from 0 to 75% in 30 minutes. The camera is still the same 13MP Sony IMX214 unit at the back with a front facing 5MP selfie shooter. Out of the box, it still runs on Android 4.4.4 KitKat that has ColorOS 2.0 running on top. Just like the original R5, the R5s also lacks a headphone jack and you’ll need a micro-USB to audio adapter if you’re planning to plug in your head phones.  The price of the OPPO R5s is quite surprising as it was listed at 199 Euros (about RM947). As comparison, the OPPO R5 in Malaysia is   at RM1,398, down from RM1,598 previously. For the specs, this is quite compelling for under RM1,000 but if only it has a bigger battery on-board."

Full instructions after the break. The self-proclaimed   is getting its first OxygenOS software update that aims to quash teething problems after its global debut. Just to recap, the OnePlus 2 comes in 2 flavours – HydrogenOS for the Chinese market and OxygenOS for international users.   The OTA update weighs 1.1GB and it will be rolled out first in India before it trickles down to the rest of the world.  As you would expect, the latest update fixes the critical Stagefright issues and it addresses other stability and performance concerns on the new device. The changelog reads as follows: 1. Download the latest Oxygen OS ROM or update file (if you’re currently running on Oxygen OS 2.0.0) 2. Connect your phone to your computer via USB and copy the file to the root folder 
3. Switch off your phone 
4. Press and hold the (Volume Down) and (Power Button) Together until the phone starts

8. Reboot after upgrade is completed.  You can read the full upgrade details  . ============ If you’ve followed our   and  , we shared that the OnePlus 2’s battery life leaves a lot to be desired. Despite having a massive 3,300mAh capacity battery, we managed to do an average of 17-19 hours on a single charge with 4 hours of screen on time. At that’s on a very light usage with no GPS disabled. Considering the OnePlus is still on a Full HD 1080p display resolution, that’s quite short compared to other flagship smart phones with higher Quad HD screens and smaller batteries. So far no issues on performance and we liked the stock-like nature of OxygenOS which feels very fluid. One of such bugs we’ve spotted is the Google Photos app. When you try to pinch and zoom, it automatically springs back to 100% width view and this is annoying. We ended up installing QuickPic viewing instead. At time of writing, the OxygenOS 2.0.1 update isn’t available on our unit yet and hopefully this would fix the problems we encountered so far."

While there are some telcos offering zero waiver for upfront payments, you’re essentially still tied down to the same phone until your 24 months duration is up.  Maxis wants to change the way you buy your smart phones by introducing the Zerolution program. It promises absolutely no payment upfront, no contracts and no interest fee over your monthly payments. Best of all, this isn’t an Easy Payment Plan that requires a credit card. Everything you hate about a phone contract be gone. Sounds too good to be true? Read on to find out.  To get a phone through Zerolution, you’ll need to pick a new   that starts from RM98/month and then pick the phone you want. By default, the monthly payment is calculated over a 24 months period and if you decide to leave, you’ll just need to pay the balance without any penalty charges. For those that want to own the latest phones every year, there’s an early upgrade option at RM30/month. So after 12 months, you can surrender your current device and switch to a newer phone without any penalty or upgrade cost. Just pick a new phone and pay the new monthly payment.  In order to upgrade, the device must be in good working order which means no cracked screen or serious dents on the device. If the device is not in good order, a RM300 fee will apply. For better peace of mind, they are offering a device protection at RM15/month that’s comes with 48 hours replacement.  For now the Zerolution program covers 4 devices – the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge, HTC One M9+ and the Samsung Galaxy A7. All new flagship devices will be available on Zerolution moving forward and gradually its existing line up including the iPhone 6 will be offered later.  Considering the easy ownership and zero penalty charges involved, the Zerolution is a hassle free way of owning a device. This isn’t a leasing program as you do own the phone after 24 months. If you calculate the monthly payment over 24 months it is cheaper than buying the phone outright at full retail price. That’s of course without the optional early upgrade (RM30/month) and device protection (RM15/month) add-on.  For those that change phones on an annual basis, this can be seen as a leasing programme as you can swap phones easily without the hassle of trading in. Once you’ve completed the full 24 months period, the phone is yours to keep.  Below is one example of buying the Galaxy S6 on Zerolution versus a typical 24 months contract."

Alexander Wong,All you need to know: 10 new features on MIUI 7,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/20/xiaomi-miui-7-top-10-features/,"Android,Custom ROM,MIUI 7,MIUI 7 Features,MIUI OS,Xiaomi","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-08-20,"After 5 years running, Xiaomi has made its global announcement of   yesterday. With its humble beginnings back in 2010, the MIUI custom ROM has grown with over 150 Million users and is supported by a team of 750 people.  While the interface looks the same as the current MIUI 6, the new version offers more customisation and it gets smarter with a several intelligent tweaks. Read on for the 10 new features after the break. Your smart phone is a personal device and MIUI has been known for its wide array of radical customisable themes. On MIUI 7, they are really pushing the themes up a notch with greater focus on design details. With Muse, a new theme creator, you can design new interfaces with animations including the lock screen like never before. And this is done without the complicated coding. Receiving phone calls can be made more interesting especially when it’s from your loved ones. Instead of having a static photo, you can change this to a 5 second looping video.  If you have tons of instant message groups and social media accounts, your phone would always be demanding for attention. While you can always turn on silent mode before sleeping, MIUI 7 is making the DND mode automated with the help of a Mi Band. The Mi Band as an activity tracker knows when you’re asleep and will automatically turns on DND mode. Once you’re awake, it is also smart enough to disable DND mode so that you start receiving alerts right away.  Especially for the elderly, viewing normal text size can be a strain. While you can easily bump up the text size, the execution isn’t always perfect with broken lines and ugly alignment. With MIUI 7, it now offers an even larger XXL size and it is done beautifully in any screen without breaking its original layout design.  Data is core in every smart phone experience. Not everyone has a huge data plan and high-speed coverage could be limited especially in developing countries. To ensure an optimal internet experience, Xiaomi has incorporated Opera Max Data Saver which helps to compress data not only in browser but also in other internet connected apps. This helps to speed up loading and will also help to cut down consumption of your precious internet quotas.  For those with kids, your smart phone is the best camera of capturing moments in any situation. If need to show photos of your baby, it can be a daunting task if your album is filled with random pictures. To make things easier, they now have a Baby Album which automatically creates a collection for your baby with the help of facial recognition.  Similar to Huawei’s Magazine cover feature, you can have a different lock screen wallpaper every single day. There’s a selection of high quality images and this will be made available first in India before it is released for international markets.   Sometimes your kids might want to “steal” your phone for a short game or two. To keep your data private and phone settings intact from curious fingers, the Child Mode lets you pick which apps and features that are accessible to them.   Performance is always a concern of users and MIUI 7 has been tweaked to provide a faster experience. App start up times have been optimised by loading both data and animations in parallel and Xiaomi claims a 30% improvement in app response.  According to Xiaomi, as much as 48% of battery life are consumed by background processes such as GPS, mobile data and WiFi. To squeeze more life from each charge, they have optimised its background usage as well as regulating app sync times to minimise consumption. As a result, this would give 10% better battery life which is equivalent of up to 3 hours extra each day.  If you can’t wait to give it a go, MIUI 7 will be available as a beta release beginning 24th August on the  . The Beta release will support Redmi 1S, Redmi 2, Mi 3, Mi 4, Mi 4i, Redmi Note 3G and Redmi Note 4G. To watch the full presentation, you can hit play in the embedded video below."

Those fortunate enough to be in possession of either Android, Windows or Blackberry devices would’ve had it since then but Apple had platform limitations earlier on. You’ll be able to make use of the WhatsApp Web client given that you have these three browsers Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera. Frequent WhatsApp users who’d prefer to have access to the app on their desktop can use the web client here and just scan the QR code using your iPhone to link your computer. Other than having a steady internet connection for your desktop, one must have their smart phones constantly connected to the internet, so WhatsApp Web can’t function if otherwise. It’ll also sync chat history and it’ll reflect on both devices the same so nothing will be lost in translation. Sending photos on the other hand, can be done by pulling files from your desktop or webcam, easing cross-platform sharing. WhatsApp on your desktop can be a win-win in the office too, saving you from always looking at your mobile phone and pretending to do work without getting caught. Just be sure to not let it affect your work productivity."

However Samsung is taking the round approach to a whole new level with its rotating bezel ring as opposed to a digital crown that’s being used on the Apple Watch. To get a taste of what to expect, they have finally released the teaser video which was first shown during last week’s event and it revolves around the circular interface.  In terms of design, Samsung has toned down its gadgetry look, opting for a normal watch appearance. With Apple pushing the Watch as a fashion piece, Samsung is expected to follow suit by offering an array of build materials and strap designs. You can view some lifestyle shots of the Gear S2 over  .  One of the pet peeves of having a circular watch is the impracticality of the display versus a square display that gives a more usable space for reading. It is fine for notifications but beyond that, it isn’t ideal for reading long text messages. Can Samsung overcome this shortcomings with the Gear S2?  We’ll find out in 2 weeks time. In the mean time, do let us know if you prefer round over square or otherwise."

Appearing in SIRIM’s list could mean that ASUS could discretely be planning a joint event to release two (or more) devices at one time. ASUS’ ZE500KG model is mainly a mid-ranger that sports a 5-inch HD 720p display with a 1.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 410, under the hood. Multitasking will be handled by the 2GB of RAM and storage comes in either 8GB or 16GB of expandable memory.

No surprises here, as the budget friendly model in the Laser series only supports 3G HSPA+ in its dual-SIM connectivity compatibility. How much will this wallet friendly device cost?

Built to look like a camera, albeit sporting a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display on the front, the phone features a camera button solely to improve usability for instant camera activation and photo taking. You’ll get a 16-megapixel sensor on the rear and a 8-megapixel front facing shooter on the smart phone – including a 16:9 BSI sensor and optical image stabilisation.

A detailed breakdown of the infrared auto-focus follows: We’ve yet to test the camera’s prowess yet but be sure to check again once we’ve received a unit to review. A readily available quick switch toggle gives users an ability to choose from the easier Auto mode, or the more in-depth Pro mode.

This is the same model that has been certified in our Malaysian SIRIM database carrying the model number SM-N9208.

Said to come from two manufacturers LG and Huawei in two sizes – a 5.2-inch phone and a 5.7-inch phablet, respectively. An alleged image of LG’s   offering has made its rounds showing how the phone looks like from the back. There’s nothing much to run on regarding the device in the image except for the camera module and a circular metal ring below the camera sensor. No branding appears on the actual body of the phone but there is a white sticker with an LG logo on it, so we can safely assume this is LG’s Nexus and not the Huawei Nexus. Protrusion of the camera could mean that the phone’s design is very thin, giving LG not much to work with in terms of how much the camera sensor juts out. Accompanying the camera (purported 16-megapixel or 20.7-megapixel) will be what seems to look like laser focus technology and dual-LED flash. Some go on to claim the circular metal ring is actually a fingerprint scanner; a design differing from Android’s design cues but very much like Apple’s (differing placements). However, we advise all of this be taken with a large dosage of salt – mainly because LG has been fairly discrete about its Nexus, though it does match older renders  . The majority believe Google will keep to its annual scheduled release of the Nexus(es) and Android M, which is due usually in October. Since there’s still 2 months to go, be sure to expect more rumours and leaks as autumm nears."

You can check out our   from the big 4 telcos.  Samsung’s latest phablets the   and   were launched last week, both offering 5.7″ Quad HD displays and 4GB of RAM. For Malaysia, both devices are expected to arrive sometime in early September and if you’re curious about its pricing, we can gather some clues from our southern neighbours. The Galaxy Note 5 had went on sale in Singapore last Saturday, 15th August with two colour options Black Sapphire and Gold Platinum. Meanwhile the double edge Galaxy S6 edge+ will be available a week later on 22nd August with the same colour options. Just like the Galaxy S6/S6 edge, the Singapore market has the option for multiple storage options with 32GB and 64GB available. For easy reference, we’ve compared the launch prices of the past Galaxy flagships in Singapore below, which are inclusive of GST. As expected, the Galaxy Note 5 is priced slightly higher than the Galaxy S6, while the Galaxy S6 edge+ is a notch higher than the S6 edge.  Based on the pricing in Singapore, we can roughly guess how much it will cost in Malaysia. With GST taking effect since April, you can expect to pay much more for the Note 5 compared to the previous RM2,499 price tag for the Galaxy Note 4. Assuming if GST was in effect back then, the Galaxy Note 4 would cost RM2,649 which is more than the Galaxy S6. Furthermore, the Note series is usually priced slightly higher than its compact Galaxy S series model. We are guessing that the Galaxy Note 5 could be priced around RM2,699 while the Galaxy S6 edge+ hovering around RM3,199. Take note that this is just an estimate and Samsung Malaysia could price them differently considering our depreciating ringgit and both phablets will be coming with Dual-SIM slots.

Budding buyers were fighting fears of the 16GB model (non-expandable) since its introduction to our shores but the 32GB variant might just be the answer to those worrying woes. Keeping the original spec sheet as it is, the device will run a second-gen Octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor (1.7 GHz) on board the 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen device and 2GBs of RAM will help optimise the MIUI skin of Android 5.0.2. Although capable of a LTE enabled dual-SIM offering, the system isn’t a hybrid SIM + MicroSD, hence why the bump in the internal memory storage is much sought after. Tomorrow is not long off but we’ll choose to speculate the pricing of the 32GB Mi 4i – India offers the two models for Rs. 12,999 (RM 814) and Rs. 14,999 (RM 939), 16GB and 32GB, respectively.

The new Note delivers a whole refreshed look, packs an amazing camera and an enhanced S Pen experience. Having had an exclusive   experience (you can read and watch about it  ) I can tell you that from the offset, the Note 5 doesn’t seem do anything ground-breaking. The Note’s crown jewels were always the big format display and exclusive stylus experience. Having said that, it’s an evolution from the   with little touches that enhance productivity and overall user experience.  Here are my favourite five top features of the Galaxy Note 5. Aside from the size of the big display, the Note 5 looks nothing like its predecessor. Gone is the faux leather and chromed frame. In fact, the Note 5 has more in common in terms of looks and build with the beautiful  . In comes a premium build with an all-metal finish and beautiful glass curved back.  What’s important to note is that, despite having a large 5.7-inch QHD AMOLED display, the Note 5 is actually smaller, thinner and lighter than the previous Note devices.  If you loved the S6 and S6 edge, then you’ll appreciate the lines, curves and feel of the new Note 5 Samsung has finally introduced a spring-loaded auto-eject mechanism to the infamous S Pen. So no more fiddling and using your nail to detach the stylus from the silo. It makes perfect sense, really, and something you’ll definitely appreciate. The S Pen itself features better build, and seems more durable and less plasticky than the previous versions.  The S Pen is more responsive and the hand-writing recognition is better than ever, making writing and drawing as natural as doing it with a real pen.  The Air Command is a Note special. Click the button on the S Pen and a pop-up menu shows up on screen. It gives you quick access apps and features. This is a much-loved feature of the Note series. With the Note 5, it gets even better. Now you can customise Air Command to modify and add up to three favourite apps to it. It’s really neat and a long time coming. This is one of those “Now why didn’t they think of this before?” features. Imagine this scenario. You need to quickly jot down something – a phone number, a message or a scribble. You’ll need to scan your fingerprint or unlock your phone, search for your app, fire up your app and then write your message. What if you can do it with a single step?  Well, now you can. Just detach the stylus and write on the screen. There is no step two. And that’s brilliant.  In smartphones, especially in the flagship Galaxy series, audio has always been something of an afterthought. Pretty strange if you think about it. Since we spend so much time on our phones listening to music, watching movies and playing games, why isn’t it made to deliver better quality sound? Audiophiles will love this. The Note 5 now has Ultra High Quality Audio (UHQA) support built in. That means you get up to 24bit/192kHz quality audio. A UHQA upscaler enhances existing MP3 music and make them all more listenable and enjoyable.  The Note 5 includes a new UHQA-Bluetooth codec which means better quality audio streamed to your favourite Bluetooth headphones. And naturally, UHQA works perfectly with Samsung LEVEL. Samsung didn’t just adopt the best design and build elements from the S6 and S6 edge. It also brought one of my biggest loves about the S6 series – the amazing camera. We’ve raved about the   and even our  .  Make no mistake, the 16MP f/1.9 snapper with OIS is stunning, the best on any smartphone. It features an enhanced software-based OIS for smooth, shake-free video. Shoot high-resolution stills or 4K video. The only limit is your imagination. For taking selfies, the Note 5 gets a 5MP shooter, which is an upgrade from a 3.7MP unit on the Note 4.  Performance is unmatched in low light and if you need fast autofocus and shutter, you’ve got the best in your hand. Photography is often spontaneous and unplanned, so simply double-click on the Home button to fire up the camera. All in under a second. So there you go, my 5 top features of the new Galaxy Note 5. I’m pretty sure you have your own favourite features, give us your thoughts below."

While the metal frame helps to absorb impact from the sides, direct drops facing downwards will definitely cause some serious damage to the screen.  Even when it was dropped with the back facing down from 1 metre height, the impact is strong enough to crack the protruding camera lens.

Alexander Wong,OnePlus 2 tear down reveals modular internals and it is easy to repair,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/19/oneplus-2-tear-down-reveals-modular-internals-and-it-is-easy-to-repair/,"OnePlus,oneplus 2,OnePlus 2 Malaysia,OnePlus 2 Repair,OnePlus 2 Tear Down,tear down","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus",2015-08-19,"The   is heading to   soon. If you’re wondering how easy it is to repair, we turn to the dismantling experts at iFixit.  Most unibody smart phones these days are quite complicated to dismantle and it is common to see them using tons of adhesive and proprietary screws that would require special tools. But not with the OnePlus 2.  With its replaceable sandstone back cover taken out, the back plate is held together with standard Phillips screws. The non-removable 3,300mAh battery is kept in place with a little adhesive and it shouldn’t pose much problems if you need to replace it. The rest of the components such as the camera module and the USB Type C port are modular, making replacements an easy task. Probably the only difficulty would be the display as the IPS LCD is fused together with the glass. So if you’ve cracked your screen, you would need to replace the whole piece which can be quite costly. Overall iFixit rates the OnePlus 2 with a repairability score of 7/10, which is easier than the first OnePlus One that   5/10. As comparison, the Galaxy S6   4/10, while the HTC One M9   at just 2/10."
Alexander Wong,Sony releases the Xperia C5 Ultra and Xperia M5 in Malaysia through 11street,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/18/sony-releases-the-xperia-c5-ultra-and-xperia-m5-in-malaysia-through-11street/,"Dual Sim,Sony,sony xperia c5 ultra,Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual,Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Malaysia,Sony Xperia M5,Sony Xperia M5 Dual,Sony Xperia M5 Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sony",2015-08-18,"Shortly after Sony Malaysia had   its   and  , we have two new models heading our way. The 6″ Sony Xperia C5 Ultra and its new compact Xperia M5 will be available for pre-orders in Malaysia through  .  Both models are dual-SIM ready and 11street will be accepting orders starting from this Wednesday, 19th August until 31st August 2015. In terms of price, surprisingly they are quite competitively priced at RM1,399 for the Xperia C5 Ultra Dual and RM1,599 for the Xperia M5. The 11street exclusive pre-orders will start shipping in early September.  To recap, the Xperia C5 Ultra is not only their new phablet but it’s also their new contender in the selfie centric space. Not only it gets a huge 6″ Full HD display, it also features 13MP cameras for both front and back. To get the best out of your selfie shots, the front camera has a wider 22mm view and it gets a soft LED Selfie Flash for better illumination. With an ultra-thin bezel, the Xperia C5 Ultra looks almost bezel-less and the shorter width makes it easy to handle with a single hand.  The internals however is similar to the current Xperia C4, with a 1.7GHz MediaTek Octa-Core Processor that’s mated with 2GB of RAM, along with 16GB of storage that’s expandable with microSD. With a 2,930mAh non-removable battery, it is rated to last up to 2 days and overall it weighs 187 grams. At RM1,399, the Xperia C5 Ultra merely RM100 more than the Xperia C4, and you get a huge upgrade in both screen and optics. You can read more in our Xperia C5 Ultra  . The Xperia M5 is looking like a compact flagship that’s a worthy successor of the  . The exterior design looks like an Xperia Z3 series and it even comes with IP68 water resistance. The Xperia M5 has a 5″ Full HD display and under the hood you’ll find MediaTek’s high-end 2.0GHz Helio X10 octa-core processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. It also gets 16GB of storage and a microSD slot that accepts up to 200GB in capacity.  In the camera department, things get a little interesting. While the Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3+ still carries the same old 20.7MP shooter, the M5 features a newer 21.5MP IMX230 sensor that’s features Phase Detection Auto Focus. The result is clearer shots of moving objects thanks to its 0.2 seconds focus time. For the narcissists, they won’t be disappointed either as the front gets a 13MP camera just like the Xperia C5 Ultra. With a smaller 2,600mAh capacity battery, the Xperia M5 still boasts up to 2 days of battery life. Overall it weighs 143 grams and has a thickness of 7.6mm.

soyacincau,Compared: Samsung Galaxy Note 5 versus Galaxy Note 4,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/14/compared-samsung-galaxy-note-5-versus-galaxy-note-4/,"galaxy note 5,S Pen,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note 4,Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Malaysia,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015,stylus","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-14,"Nearly a year has gone since the   and flash-forward to the present with the arrival of the much anticipated   is a reality. Today we aim to pit the old against the new and discuss the main differences, mainly positive but some questionable. The mobile tech giant has made some brand-new features both in hardware and software. Mentioning the former first, the processor gets an upgrade from the Exynos 5433 (SM-N910C) / Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 (SM-N910S) to the chart-topping AnTuTu scorer, the Exynos 7420. Samsung’s newest phablet also gets a 1GB bump in the RAM department compared to the Note 4 (3GB), adhering to the current industry standard for new flagships. Furthering connectivity speeds is the Note 5’s latest LTE Cat 6/Cat 9 pushing the older Cat 4 enabled Note 4 out of the water, with blistering future-proof speeds once telecommunication infrastructure is done catching up. Moving to the camera, we’ll see a similar 16-megapixel main camera, but the front shutter is now 5-megapixels from the previous 3.7-megapixels. Samsung has said to make the camera interface zippier as launching speeds have improved from 1.1 seconds to 0.6 seconds. Audio advancements are now up scaled to support an ultra-high-quality listening experience – couple that with Samsung Milk Music and you’ll be set to enjoy yourself. The star of the show of course will be the spring loaded eject-able S-Pen that will no longer chip anymore finger nails. Samsung has promised that the feeling of writing will be as close as to writing on paper but hasn’t mentioned raw specifications of increasing pressure sensitivity as for now. Hardware aside, it’ll also be enhanced to Scroll Capture long screenshots with Screen Write: a sure favourite for long direction instructions and conversations. Air command will now always appear on-screen to assist you with your S-Pen functionality. Off-screen notes can be easily written with the S-Pen just by simply tapping on the screen with the stylus while in standby. PDF annotations are also easier with the S-Pen, giving users the means to simply sign a PDF document using the stylus and sending it off to be printed for your business needs. Design language also takes a turn with the latest iteration of the Note series. Gone are the days of plastically backs and in comes a more superior built product. Comparing the old and the new side by side and you’ll be able to tell them distinctively apart, especially so when you take a look around the edges and rounded backing of the Note 5. Placement of the camera and audio speakers have been adjusted to make the device better to look at and change the listening experience a little. Making up the bottom is now the moved speaker, and audio jack, while the positions of the S-Pen and micro-USB port remain. The phablet is now lighter too, weighing in at 171g, opposed to 176g (Note 4) and comes in a smaller footprint – 153.2 x 76.1 x 7.6mm compared to the slightly larger Note 4 (153.5 x 78.6 x 8.5mm) Samsung has addressed some qualms – mostly related to its stance on premium materials and removable batteries. Seeing a change of trend towards users who prefer a more luxurious feel, the Korean manufacturer has decided that it was time to exclude removable batteries in replacement of a metal encased design From the S6 series to the current Note 5, we’re now seeing a more streamlined aesthetically pleasing device with more metal and glass. Although, there will always be trade-offs and this time it’s no exception, as the glass will pick up finger prints and smudges quite easily. The battery also takes a hit, now only 3,000mAh battery housed in non-removable fashion due to the unibody design, which dips from the old Note 4 – 3,220mAh. Worry not, as the Note 5 will be helped along by fast charging the device from 0% – 100% takes 90 minutes, 9 minutes quicker than its predecessor. If cables is not your thing, you’ll be happy as the newer Note even supports fast wireless charging, although charge times are nothing to shout about (0% – 100% in 120 minutes). Other than the removable battery omission, we’re also seeing an exodus of MicroSD support from the Note 5 – unsure why they decided to go down this route, seeing as dual-SIM trays usually are hybrids, allowing users to choose two SIMs or use one + a MicroSD card. Lastly, seemingly seen as an odd decision, Samsung decided to leave out the infared blaster seen on older released devices. To cap-off, the Note 5 has made refinements in these categories: and sacrificed some features in the process, as well: We’ll see how the Note 5 fares when it goes on sale in selected regions, while it’ll make an appearance sometime in September for our local market."

Touted to be the first tablet with customisable functional back covers, ASUS is adding the ZenPad 7.0 (Z370CG) into its tablet line-up and it joins its entry-level  . The ZenPad series is the tablet equivalent of its Zenfone line up and eventually this would replace its current FonePad and MeMoPad tablet series. Although, not booming with power the tablet runs a respectable Quad-core 64-bit Intel Atom x3-C3230 processor. RAM and internal storage of this budget device will slot in at 2GB and 16GB, respectively. Should you need more storage to store your movies, the ZenPad 7.0 comes with a microSD slot that supports up to 128GB extra. The 7-inch screen promises a 1280 x 800 (HD) resolution IPS display and will be sure to please those looking for an affordable HD capable tablet. Camera optics stand at an 8-megapixel rear sensor, while the front gets only a 2-megapixel shutter. Those consuming media could be interested in the DTS-HD front speaker that the ZenPad 7.0 is equip with – touted to offer premium sound by ASUS. As a portable media device, the tablet will be considered quite light; 272g. It should be noted that the screen to body ratio is 72% and the dimensions are 189 x 110.9 x 8.7mm – considered light and compact for its dimensions, probably due to the plastic body that still has an upmarket feel, thanks to the leather-looking texture. Given the device’s affordable nature, it doesn’t come with 4G LTE and we’ll only get a 3G model that supports a single SIM. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS’ own Zen UI. Functionality will be one of the main aspects of the 7-inch tablet with a slew of easily detachable back covers, each with its own use.  For a touch of personalisation there’s a variety of of colourful Zen Cases that snaps on easily. For a longer battery life, there’s a Power Case pushes a total of up to 15 hours of battery life on a single charge.

According to ASUS, the ZenPad 7.0 will be sold below RM700 and it is expected to go on sale on 26th of August. So far that’s all we have for the ZenPad series and ASUS Malaysia is still mum on the availability of the rest of the ZenPad line up which includes the ZenPad 8.0 and the top-of-the-line  .

Coming in two parts the back cover that holds on to the back of either the   or the  , the   can be snapped on and off easily in either orientation (front for typing, back for utilising the whole screen). Samsung has had a   of venturing to a wide range of stuff so this doesn’t really surprise anyone (just to spoil it for you, it includes a toilet seat, helicopter, and hospital). Typing will be supported by the QWERTY style keyboard that has 3 Android buttons – Recent Apps, Home and Back button. One could assume that the Keyboard Cover would benefit to those who felt that the typing experience on the two said phablets wouldn’t be a great experience when one-handed. We spent a short time with the Keyboard Cover attached to the edge+: describing the keys akin to a soft resin-like texture and it felt flimsy at best. A lackluster solution but tries to appeal to those who like tactility when typing on the capacitive screen. These tactile inclinded typist that prefer BlackBerry’s signature typing experience might just consider jumping ship given the option to add this US  $80 extension. The keyboard itself doesn’t have any special technology, merely the keys will touch the screen as if your fingertips would but it does move up the UI when the keyboard is in place. Now the real question comes about; would you buy it?"
Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge gets a Plus for a bigger screen,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/14/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-hands-on-first-impressions/,"Android,Curved Display,Dual Sim,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus first impressions,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus hands on,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-14,"If you’ve always wanted to get an   for its dual curve display but held back due to its smaller 5.1″ size, the folks at Samsung has probably heard your prayer. Like the name suggests, the   is a larger Galaxy S6 edge with a phablet size display. The screen isn’t the only thing that has been upgraded as the the internals for both hardware and software have gotten plus size in their own areas.  Underneath this familiar looking device, the Galaxy S6 edge+ is an identical Galaxy Note 5 underneath minus the productivity S-Pen. Strangely Samsung didn’t release the successor of the  , but instead they have upgraded an existing Galaxy S smart phone it into a phablet device.  The Galaxy S6 edge is a beautiful looking thing but holding it isn’t as reassuring as the flat edged Galaxy S6. On the bigger Galaxy S6 edge+, it is no different. The front has curved front glass that slops onto its thin frame. If we have both the S6 edge+ and Note 5 side by side, the Note feels more reassuring to hold with its thicker sides and a curved back glass that’s more natural to hold. The rest are identical, from the placement of its volume and power buttons down to its headphone jack, micro USB port and speaker grill. Looking at the top, you’ll find a SIM tray slot and that’s when you notice that it lacks an infrared blaster that used to be located in the middle. The front display is a Note category 5.7″ display that does a similar Quad HD resolution (2560×1440) with a pixel density of 518 ppi. Overall, it is a tiny bit thinner at 6.9mm (S6 edge: 7.0mm) and it is 21 grams heavier at 153g (S6 edge: 132g).   Although it shares the same Octa-Core Exynos processor, the Galaxy S6 edge+ gets 4GB RAM, which is 1GB more than the standard model. For storage, it has the same non-expandable 32GB or 64GB storage options using Samsung’s speedy Universal Flash Storage 2.0 solution. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery, which is 400mAh more than its smaller brother. While it gets the same native wireless charging, the Galaxy S6 edge+ like the Note 5 now supports faster wireless charging which does 0-100% charge in 2 hours.  Compared to the Galaxy Note Edge, the S6 edge curved display doesn’t offer as much features due to its reduced curvature at the sides. Instead of a permanent “edge” panel, the edge display that’s customisable for either left or right was mostly used for People Edge, a customisable bar with 5 of your closest contacts. In addition, Samsung wants you to reach out to your contacts in a more emotional manner. So in addition to the typical call, SMS and email, the People Edge lets you send sketches, emoticons and video. As mentioned in our  , we prefer if Samsung adds the option for instant message considering it is the main communication channel these days. While the screen is off, you still can take a peek on your notifications and infostream when you rub from left to right on the edge.  In addition, they have introduced “Apps Edge” which offers additional 5 edge shortcuts for your favourite apps. Since the S6 edge+ shares similar underpinnings as the non-plus model, we reckon Samsung could be extending these additions for its current S6 edge models. Another nice touch is that the edge features are now accessible on any screen. As comparison, it could only be triggered on the home screen and you can’t toggle it if you’re running other apps.  
The rest of the S6 edge+ remains unchanged. You get the same excellent 16MP f/1.9 OIS camera at the back and a front facing 5MP f/1.9 camera at the front for better lit selfies. Similar to the Note 5, it does get Live YouTube Broadcast from the camera app as well. Nope, the battery isn’t removable and despite us getting a dual-SIM version in Malaysia, there’s no microSD expansion for the S6 edge+ either.  So would you pick this over the Galaxy Note 5? They are identically the same underneath and the only difference is the curve display and productive S-Pen that sets them apart. The edge display to us has always been a technological showcase and it is hard to justify to pay a lot over a non-edge device for the sake of having a fancier screen. So the question of whether to get a Note 5 or an S6 edge+ really depends on whether you want something you can do more with or having a device that’s good to look at."

With more players cashing in on the big screen phablet game, Samsung has to stay ahead beyond just having a bigger screen and better specs. The last Galaxy Note 4 was a great device but it faced stiffer competition with the likes of the iPhone 6 Plus.  With an early announcement for 2015, the Galaxy Note 5 aims to secure its spot as the new king of the hill for the remainder of 2015. Read on for our hands-on experience to find out about this 5th generation productivity phablet.    Before that let’s talk more about the device. The overall build quality has been improved and you get the same premium look and feel as the Galaxy S6. Gone is the faux leather back that made its debut on the Galaxy Note 3 and it now gets a stylish looking curve glass at the back, that’s similar to the  . This design somewhat makes the device to better to hold as compared to the Galaxy S6 edge which has little area to grip with its thin metal frame. The screen size of 5.7″ has been retained but Samsung has managed to make the Galaxy Note 5 thinner (7.6mm) and lighter (171g) than its predecessor. On-board the Galaxy Note 5 gets a choice of either 32GB and 64GB storage options. Like the Galaxy S6, there’s no expandable microSD card memory and you would need to rely on cloud storage for further expansion. The front Super AMOLED display still retains its Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440 and it pushes a pixel density of 518 ppi, which is still among the sharpest in its class. Powering the internals is a familiar 14nm process Exynos Octa-Core processor that’s mated with 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. The decision of using the same processor as the Galaxy S6 isn’t a bad thing considering it performed well and it is still the best performing processors out there at the moment. From our brief experience, the processor and the generous 4GB RAM combo combined promises a buttery smooth experience for the hardcore multi-taskers.  The S-Pen has been completely redesigned. Gone are the days where you need to pry the end with your fingernails as the Note 5 features an eject mechanism, popping up the end of the S-Pen with a light push. In the last Note 4, the S-Pen has doubled its pressure sensitivity to 2048 levels. On the new Note 5, Samsung claims to have improved the experience, making it as close to writing on paper.   Taking down notes is even faster on the Note 5 as you can start scribbling on the front display even while the screen is off. This saves time unlocking the device and finding the app to jot your notes down. The Air Command has been improved with more customisation and it allows you to add shortcuts to your favourite apps. As we move towards a digital office, there are some things that still require analog input. With the Note 5’s enhanced handwriting feature, you can now digitally sign PDF documents and have it sent out by email instantly. So you save time printing and re-scanning documents. Another neat feature is taking screenshots with its scroll capture. This allows you to capture a whole web page or a long chat message in a single action.  For those that still prefer to type on a tactile keyboard, Samsung has also released a Keyboard Cover which lets you type on a full QWERTY keyboard. The case is surprisingly thin and it lays over the touch screen covering the bottom portion of the device. There’s no batteries or bluetooth pairing required and it connects directly on the touch screen display. When not in use, you can move the keyboard towards its back cover.  The Galaxy Note 5 gets a 16MP f/1.9 main camera that’s assisted with optical image stabilisation and it is capable of shooting 4K videos. The front camera gets a 5MP f/1.9 unit, that’s also similar with the Galaxy S6. To launch the camera at any time, it is also triggered by double pressing on the home button. For great shots anytime, it has Auto HDR for both front and back cameras.  In terms of features, it gets better stabilisation for video and now there’s also an option to broadcast your moments live on YouTube. This isn’t new for a flagship smart phone but nevertheless it is a good option to have especially when you need to share an important moment in real time. Just make sure you’re in a location with fast upload speeds on 4G.  
For high speed downloads, the Note 5 supports 4G LTE up to Cat 9 speeds, where available. It also gets 802.11ac WiFi with MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC. Surprisingly Samsung has dropped its Infrared blaster, which has always being a standard feature on its previous flagships.  Health still remains one of Samsung’s key focus and it still retains a heart rate sensor module that also houses its camera’s LED flash. For the very first time in Malaysia, the Galaxy Note 5 will come with Dual-SIM slots, which is good news for globetrotters and mobile warriors that want to separate both personal and work lines.  Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery that supports both fast charging by cable as well as wireless charging. Using compatible adaptive fast charge, it takes 90 minutes for a full charge. The Galaxy Note 5 has also improved its wireless charging speeds, with 0-100% being accomplished in 2 hours. Like the S6, it supports both wPC and PMA wireless charging standards.  The Galaxy Note 5 comes in four colours – White Pearl, Black Sapphire, Gold Platinum and Silver Titanium. US and Canada will be among the first in the world to get it starting next week 21st August, with the rest of the world to follow shortly after.  Some might argue that the Galaxy Note 5 is just an incremental upgrade from the Galaxy S6 but the winning formula is more than just better specs and a larger screen. For those who have gotten hooked to the S-Pen, the Galaxy Note 5 is a direct upgrade path with the top notch specs crafted in a premium package.  Want to get more things done with a bigger screen? The Galaxy Note 5 still offers one of the best multi-tasking features that have been perfected over the years. Granted that the previous TouchWiz were pretty bloaty, the new iteration is much lighter and certainly there’s still room for Samsung to improve. For those who are not convinced with the S-Pen in the previous model, you certainly should give this version a try."

The first details are about the graphical performance and the new image signal booster (ISP). They unfortunately haven’t given out anything else about the 64-bit chip, like its running temperature. The Adreno 530 GPU has a leg up on its predecessor, the Adreno 430 GPU that was in the Snapdragon 810 with the aforementioned 40% increase in graphic capability according o benchmarks. It also has a nice 40% decrease in power consumption too, thanks to power gating that lets the GPU go faster to idle modes and save power. So this means in the long run you’ll get to play/watch more. The GPU also includes OpenCL 2.0, OpenGL ES 3.1, the Android Extension pack as well as Renderscript with backwards compatibility. Video processing will be getting quite a boost as well thanks to the additional compute performance. As for the new Spectra ISP, the company says that you will be getting better image quality; with a maximum supported resolution of 25 megapixels with 30 fps video recorded at max resolution. The new setup will also be able to handle multi-camera setups with up to three sensors working in tandem, an improved hybrid autofocus framework as well as more natural skin tone reproduction.

While the previous   is seen as a cheap and good, the new version has moved the Redmi series up to the flagship league while maintaining its affordable price of under 1,000 CNY (RM625).  The Redmi Note 2 is much thinner, lighter and narrower than the previous Redmi Note thanks to its compact design and narrower bezels. It looks like a bigger   and it has a 5.5″ IPS display which now pushes Full HD 1080p resolution. Overall, it is 8.25mm thin and weighs just 160 grams.  The Redmi Note 2 is definitely no slouch as it gets MediaTek’s 64-bit Helio X10 MT6795 Octa-Core processor, which is the same unit that’s powering the   and  . It consists of True 8x A53 cores that can run simultaneously.

Speculators have come to a conclusion that it’s definitely an   coming our way. A device that   (200,000 units) in just 2 minutes in China, it could possibly give other mid-range competitors a good fight locally. Making an appearance in SIRIM Malaysia’s database as PLK-L01 as of yesterday, further fuels that the device will arrive soon enough, with no tentative date that we can tell for now. As a rough indication for European markets, there has been rumours that the device will make an appearance in September during IFA 2015. Power-packed for its price the Honor 7 features a 5.2-inch 1080p Full HD display and retails (China market) in 3 versions. The lowest – 16GB internal storage and LTE, middle option – 16GB and dual-SIM LTE and the top end model – 64GB and the same dual-SIM LTE. No mention if these will be the same variants that make it to Malaysia but it’ll be a rough indication what to expect. Aside from all the cellular and internal memory differences, all 3 share a Kirin 935 processor that has 8 cores: 4 high powered running at 2.2GHz and 4 efficient cores clocked at 1.5GHz. While, those on a strict budget can opt for the more affordable 16GB dual-SIM LTE model but make use of the MicroSD slot that is available on all variants. Camera bugs who emphasise on pixels will be pleased with a 20-megapixel Sony sensor protruding out of the back of the smart phone, while a decent 8-megapixel shutter makes up the front. The Honor 7 will also come with a fingerprint scanner for biometric security functionality. 3GB of RAM gives the device ample memory to handle multitasking on the distinctive EMUI 3.1 overlay of Android 5.0 Lollipop.

A much anticipated refresh of the   series will be unveiled tomorrow. Taking place in the Big Apple itself, it’ll also feature the newer and bigger  .  Introduced  , the Galaxy Note series had created a whole new phablet category, promising a tablet-like experience in a smart phone form factor. With a 5.3″ screen, it was considered quite huge during its time and most flagship smart phones are at least 5.5 inches these days. Can Samsung maintain its phablet king status in its 5th generation? Here’s the stuff we know about the Galaxy Note 5 / S6 edge+ and it’s quite a mouthful. Practically everything has already been leaked but the weight of this information should always be taken with a grain of salt to ensure no disappointment. For the Note 5, we’ve seen mock-ups,  , benchmarks and even the  !  Not short on building the hype for the actual device, which is assumed to carry either a 64-bit Exynos 7420 Octa-core processor or a better Exynos 7422 with an all-in-one chip solution. Screen size will stick to the 5.7-inch footprint and utilise its own Super AMOLED display technology with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 (Quad HD). Performance will be helped along with an ample amount of RAM at 4GB and internal storage will cap off at 32GB. Some will be put-off by omitting the microSD option but will take comfort in the S-pen being improved to auto-eject through a spring loaded mechanism. Some sources go on to say that the device will be as heavily skinned as previous iterations, as TouchWiz and S-pen apps will be taking the load from the 4GB, leaving probably about only half left to be used. Snapping photos will be made using a 16-megapixel rear shooter that takes advantage of OIS feature and the front will be a decent 5-megapixel sensor, similar to its current Galaxy S6. In terms of battery capacity, the Galaxy Note 5 is said to be having a 3,000mAh capacity battery that’s non-removable. Just like the Galaxy S6, the battery is smaller than its predecessors but Samsung reckons that its frugal Exynos processor and Universal Flash Storage would sip less power.   Skimming only halfway through, we’ve yet to mention the Galaxy S6 edge+. Design aesthetics will not be much to rave about for the S6 edge+ will retain the same design as the S6 edge, just a slight increase in its width and length (obviously being a 5.7-inch display). The processor is likely to be the same Exynos 7420 powerhouse but it gets 4GB of RAM just like the Note 5. The battery is expected to be similar with the Note 5, housing a 3,000mAh capacity unit that’s embedded into its unibody form.  The double edge display will also be   with more features so you can use it for more than just contacting your 5 favourite contacts. For better productivity, Samsung is expected to introduce a   accessory which turns the S6 edge+ into a full QWERTY typing machine. A   indicates that the keyboard add-on would cost 60 Euros, or approximately RM263 when converted directly.  For those juggling between 2 mobile plans, the new Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ are very likely to come with   support as spotted recently on our SIRIM certification database. While there’s no microSD expansion slots, there are those who are hoping that Samsung might allow you to pop-in a microSD card onto the 2nd SIM slot just like its current  . Though all this information has come out, we’ve yet to hear anything about the price range of the two devices. Based on past launch prices of these devices, we’ll attempt to speculate the range of Samsung’s newest additions: Looking at how Samsung priced their previous models and considering GST has kicked in, we reckon that the Galaxy Note 5 could be priced around RM 2,699, while the Galaxy S6 edge+ hovers above the RM 3,100 mark. Definitely they are not going to be cheap but it is still more affordable than the iPhone 6 Plus that’s priced at RM3,126 for its base 16GB model. With 2 new flagship phones, we expect Samsung to slash prices of its current Galaxy S6/S6 edge by about RM200-300 and this is   worldwide. In terms of availability, the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+ could go on sale as early as end of this month. For Malaysia, we reckon both models could go on sale in  ."

In terms of design, it looks like a bigger version of the   and its rear camera lens is placed right smack in the middle.

However the Redmi Note 2 seems to be packing some serious firepower with MediaTek’s 2.0GHz Octa-Core   that’s mated to 2GB of RAM. The processor is a Helio X10 unit, which is rather high-end and could be found on flagship devices like the HTC One M9+ and One E9+. For storage is gets 16GB which is expandable with microSD. For imaging it has a 13MP main + 5MP front cameras and powering the device is a 3,020mAh capacity battery.

Samsung’s unpacked event in New York today finally confirmed rumours and debunked some in the process, so say hello to the new   and the  . Home-grown Exynos processors make an appearance and have been leading the way to better performance of our Samsung portable devices. Samsung might prove doubters wrong that every new generation, beckons the need for better performance; justifying the similar Exynos 7420 making a reappreance. Reusing the same processor as the old guard isn’t a totally horrible idea, as it continues to top AnTuTu benchmarks with over 67,000 points. The Galaxy S6 edge’s double edge display now gets a +, stretching the screen to phablet stardom at 5.7-inches. We might have a bigger screen but the other innards are all the same, except for a bigger battery. When the Galaxy S6 edge was first introduced, it came with a couple of features including a People’s Edge which brings your 5 favourite contacts closer to you. With the S6 edge+, they have enhanced this further with Apps Edge which allows you to put 5 app shortcuts within a thumb’s reach. In addition, the edge features are now accessible in any screen interface, instead of being limited to just the home screen. Even though internally it is very much the same but the introduction of the new Keyboard Cover accessory further enhances the typing experience on a large smart phone – giving it a more ergonomic feel that could possibly please die hard BlackBerry users. The Galaxy Note 5 is a similar device with the Galaxy S6 edge+, offering a 5.7″ Quad HD display and a similar Exynos Octa-Core processor with 4GB of RAM. The S-Pen is the key differentiation in the Galaxy Note series and already in its fifth generation, we’ve seen a steady progression of innovation. From AirView during the beginning to an extension of features which includes Action Memo, Screen Write and increasing pressure sensitivity. The Note 5 promises to bring a stylus experience to another level – touting it to be a close second to writing on paper. Accompanying the S-Pen’s housing silo which now has a push to eject mechanism will be the standard micro USB charging port. But if you’re not into cables, you could make use of its built-in wireless charging properties of the device which is similar to the Galaxy S6. You’ll get a 0% to 100% charge with the cable in 90 minutes with Adaptive Fast Charging, while wireless charging takes a little longer – 120 minutes for a full charge. Optimisation of the TouchWiz will be influential in keeping the lights on the 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED screened phablet that pushes a pixel density 518 ppi. That latest battery-friendly Exynos processor and 4GB RAM might help and hopefully won’t stump the 3,000mAh battery too much as the older Note 4 survived quite well on a battery larger by 220mAh. Encased in metal and glass, the Note 5 will be thinner and among the lightest Note ever, weighing just 169g. For imaging we’ll see a familiar 16-megapixel sensor on the back with Optical Image Stabilisation coupled with a 5-megapixel front camera. Moving on to another sensory experience, the Note 5 will return with UHQ audio capabilities which helps to upscale low bit audio to a higher quality. Probably the biggest omission on the new Note would be a microSD slot and a removable battery, a trend which is slowly disappearing with flagship smart phones today. Both phablets will be making their way to our shores with dual-SIM enabled, catering to those who prefer to have one mobile devices for work and their social life. Also included as standard is its signature heart rate sensor and a capacitive home button that doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. In terms of availability, it is expected to go on sale in Malaysia as early as first week of September.

The Mi WiFi nano supports 802.11n connectivity with speeds up to 300Mbps and it boast superior signal strength with its external PCB Antennas. This is good enough to cover a space of about 150 square metres.  For ease of management and monitoring, the Mi WiFi is connected via a mobile app that comes with an easy to use interface.

PIECE may be your solution – designed to look like a phone battery that is relatively the size of a credit card, this tiny device allows you to pop your second SIM card in and receive calls and text through your smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0. Launched since the 27  of July, 2015, PIECE had already accomplished being 100% pledged in only 1 day. Since then, the company has tripled their initial funding and have promised an Android version on the way as well. PIECE currently only has plans to support GSM, EGSM, DCS and PCS SIMs; SIM types that are supported are Micro SIM and Nano SIM’s can be used through a PIECE adapter. The device is said to provide 150 hours of stand-by time but only 4 hours of call time on a single charge. Contacts on the other hand, will be accessed either from your SIM in PIECE or your contact list on your smart phone through the PIECE app. All calls and messages will run through the PIECE app and notable features include the ability to warn you, when your phone is getting out of range. This security alert trigger when your phone or device is 10 metres away from each other. As is meant to be designed small and with small things come those times when you can’t find them – this is why the creators gave an option to find either PIECE or your smart phone through the app or PIECE’s function key. Although being able to support calls and texts, the device will not support cellular data, a bummer to those wanting to use one line for calls/text and the other for only data. Users who don’t own a smart phone but an iOS device will be pleased to know that PIECE supports the iPod Touch and non-cellular iPad. Here’s the breakdown of the cost backing PIECE on Kickstarter: CAD $70 (RM 211) to CAD $80 (RM 241) – one PIECE (depending how quickly you back the project) CAD $80 (RM 241) to CAD $90 (RM 271) – one PIECE and one card holders (depending how quickly you back the project) CAD $120 (RM 361) – two PIECE CAD $140 (RM 421) – two PIECE and two card holders Shipping is an additional CAD $ 15 (RM 46) or CAD $20 (RM 61) depending which options you choose from the above.

One of which is its new inclusion in  ; a new company who will be managing Google and all it associated products. This means that there will be an extra eye on Google as a company and Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies and according to Google the move was meant to make their operations cleaner and more accountable as they push new technologies like their glucose detecting smart contact lenses and . This of course, will be affecting users on a more subtle level for now, but the new company wants to make a real difference in the long term view. So we might be seeing changes in the way Google operates (as they say this new Google is “slimmer” than it used to be) and perhaps even more growth as they are going to be focusing on pushing on potentials they already have. Alphabet Inc. will be replacing Google Inc. as will Google shares convert into the same number of shares for Alphabet, essentially making Google a wholly-owned subsidiary of said company. But don’t worry, all the apps we know and love will be staying the same for now. In terms of leadership, co-founder Larry Page will be the CEO of Alphablet Inc while Sergey Brin holds the President position. Meanwhile Sundar Pichai which used to head Android has now been appointed as CEO of Google Inc.   What do you think this big change will bring for Google?"

Internally it is pretty much the same as the current S6 edge except for 4GB of RAM and a larger 3,000mAh capacity. Like the current S6 edge, there’s no removable battery but some are speculating that the dual-SIM slot might offer a hybrid microSD/2nd SIM card option.  From the earlier  , the IR Blaster is missing from the top but this could be an early prototype which could turn out differently in the final product. While the S6 edge+ lacks the productivity S-Pen from the Note series, an interesting   was spotted which could give the device a full QWERTY typing experience.

Consisting of two magnetic parts: the adapter (plugs into your existing cable’s connector) and the connector (stays in your device’s charging port). A simple solution that will attempt to lessen fraying, tripping and fiddling with your cables. Built initially for Micro USB and iOS’ lighting adapter only, the company has added a stretch goal of future-proof USB Type-C. All aforementioned goals have already been reached, with the company raking up an excess of $2.5 million Canadian Dollars so far in funding. One would wonder why Apple didn’t bother capitalising and licensing this technology much earlier but the folks at Znaps have refuted claims of patent infringement and possible suing – saying that this is why they didn’t create a cable mechanism, instead deploying custom adapters and connectors. Znaps aims to provide support for Quick Charge 2.0 giving it future-proofing factors in the long run. The nifty add-on will also let data transfers to function normally, as per usual cable and is seemingly compatible with other devices that use a Micro-USB, lighting and USB Type-C ports (power banks, laptops using USB Type-C, and other peripherals that require charging/data transfers) Cross-cable swapping (if that’s even a term) will be made easy – so basically you won’t be dictated by what cable you have, simply as long as you have the right adapter and the right connector to your device.

Despite having an all metal build, the R7 is lighter than its ultra-slim   at just 147 grams.  In terms of design, the OPPO R7 is identical to its R7 Lite and the only way to tell the difference is the display, since the Lite version pushes just HD 720p resolution. Another difference is the operating system where the OPPO R7 still runs on Android 4.4 KitKat. This is surprising since its R7 Lite and R7 Plus are already running on Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box.

At yesterday’s Zen Festival event in New Delhi, ASUS has announced a new Zenfone 2 Laser line up that runs on Qualcomm’s processors instead. To make it stand out from the current Zenfone 2, it gets an extra Laser AF feature, hence the “Laser” moniker. This allows the camera to focus onto subjects as quick as 0.3 seconds especially under low light. Meanwhile the design is still unmistakably a Zenfone 2 with a curve back and a rear mounted volume rocker. Typical of ASUS, the Zenfone 2 Laser comes in 4 different variants with various screen size ranging from 5 to 6 inches. It starts with the ZE500KG and ZE500KL that comes with a 5″ HD 720p display. The ZE500KG is the lowest denominator as it supports dual-SIMs with just 3G HSPA+ connectivity. It runs a 1.2GHz Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 processor that’s mated with 2GB of RAM and it comes with either 8GB or 16GB of storage that’s expandable with microSD. For imaging, it gets an 8MP f/2.0 rear shooter with Laser AF and PixelMaster technology. Meanwhile the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 selfie shooter. Powering the device is a 2,070 mAh battery and it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop with its ZenUI. The ZE500KL is similar with the ZE500KG but it is slightly better with support for 4G LTE and has a higher resolution 13MP f/2.0 main camera. Another difference is the battery where it is listed to come with either a 2,070mAh unit or a larger 2,400mAh option. These models would compete directly with the likes of the   that are priced under RM500. Moving up a notch is the 5.5″ Zenfone 2 Laser which is likely to be the popular choice. The front display is a larger 5.5″ size with a HD 720p resolution and accompanying it is a generous 3,000mAh capacity battery. Under the hood, it is the same story with a Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. It also comes with the same 13MP f/2.0 and 5MP f/2.0 camera combo, dual-SIMs with 4G LTE and a microSD slot supporting up to 128GB cards. For those wanting a bigger screen like the former  , there’s also a 6 inch variant and it gets beefier specs with a Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. Unlike the previous models, the 6″ ZE601KL gets a Full HD (1920×1080) display for greater clarity.

In terms of performance, the Intel Z3580 processor has   than Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 801 processors. Since the Zenfone brand is often associated being cheap and good, the price would be the main deciding factor.

Blass goes on to state that Huawei will go on to launch this device during IFA 2015, on the 2  of September. Based on the design language and timing of the launch, this could very well mean that their latest device will take over the current 6-inch   phablet but conflicting reports say otherwise. Media correspondents from China are claiming this could be Huawei’s stab at a smaller screened device. Slated to include a 4.7-inch screen that pushes 1920 x 1080 pixels, the device will run a Kirin Octa-core processor and have a Mali-T624 graphics on-board – based on information from AnTuTu’s benchmark site. If the aforementioned specs leave you quite disappointed, you’ll be happy to hear the opposing rumours of the latest device. Considering that the Mate 7 utilised the latest and greatest processor at its time of release, if it were to be the Mate 8 that arrives, it’ll potentially feature a yet to be seen Kirin 950 processor. The processor in question will be capable of clock speeds that max out at 2.4GHz, which is promising. This means it could definitely give the Snapdragon 810 and the Exynos 7420 a run for its money. All of this numbers are only in theory, nothing has be shown in practice yet but the 64-bit processor will support 4K video, USB 3.0 transfers, LPDDR4 RAM , and a i7 co-processor for sensor hub and security processing. Audio-enthusiasts will also be awed at the processor’s dedicated DSP audio co-processor (Tensilica Hi-Fi 4 DSP). However, don’t jump the gun yet, as they are only rumours and leaks. As IFA draws closer, surely more information will come to light and we’ll have to see whether it’ll be a Mate 7 Mini or the beastly Mate 8."

The keyboard covers up the bottom portion of the device and it offers the typical 3 Android buttons for Recent Apps, Home and Back. It does look interesting but the overall solution does look bulky considering this is a phablet category device. Furthermore with the attachment in place, we wonder if there’s another fingerprint sensor on the add-on keyboard since the home button has been covered fully.  If you love the tactile feel of a physical keyboard, this may be your cup of tea and it has been a long time since we saw a new Android device with a full keyboard.

A grand launching of sorts, Acer’s latest convertible will be the first device in Malaysia to have   pre-installed. Marketed to those interested in a portable compact device that is designed with a 360-degree hinge the Aspire R 11 will take advantage of Windows Continuum and the tiling layout of the tablet mode.

Here’s a quick recap of the timeline of events that lead-up to OnePlus’ industry first grand VR launch as follows: 
 So following the VR launch, we only saw one device but at two different capacities, 16GB and 64GB. While this conflicts with earlier reports from Carl Pei, himself, this could just mean it wasn’t time yet for this particular OnePlus smartphone . Although, it’s confirmed that there is a OnePlus mini on the way, where the phone could be completely redesigned and more aesthetically focused as opposed to just being internally powerful. Mr Pei, went on to iterate that he was very close to choosing this upcoming device over the OnePlus 2 and it’ll be hard for users to decide between the two, so maybe those interested in picking up their new OnePlus toy should wait around Christmas to compare the two before making a purchase. During the interview, Pei also hit back at criticism behind omitting NFC from the OnePlus 2. He said that “Very few people are using NFC, so we cut it. It’s as simple as that”. He then went on to say most users keep their devices at a 12 to 18 month life-cycle, so by that time, there might be a reason to put it on OnePlus’ next phone. The current OnePlus 2, will likely come to Malaysian shores in the next couple of months. As SIRIM certification has been completed it won’t be too long before a partnership between distributor, Brightstar and Maxis lets us pick up the phone in stores. A short specs recap of the OnePlus 2 for those interested – the OnePlus 2 is equipped with a 5.5” Full HD display that is capable of a 1500:1 contrast aspect ratio, the infamous but revamped Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 Octa-core processor mated to 4GB of RAM. The camera gets a bump too with a 13-megapixel shooter, which is accompanied by Optical Image Stabilisation technology and Laser Auto Focus, while the front dons a 5-megapixel sensor. Powering all this is a larger 3,300 mAh battery that will be charged using the newest USB Type C connector and the “2” will also support dual Nano-SIMs that are 4G LTE enabled. The 16GB version of the “2” retails at US$329 (approx RM 1,256), while the 64GB variant goes for US$389 (approx RM1,485)."

Looking at the “7” teaser, Xiaomi might just incorporate some of the flat Material Design appearance this time around and it will be likely based on the current Android 5.1.1. With   expected to go live by end of this year, Xiaomi seriously needs to look beyond just Lollipop. In terms of availability, their current flagships like the Mi Note and Mi 4i could be among the first to get it before it trickles down to the rest of its Redmi family. Will Xiaomi announce a new device? It might be possible but we are not expecting a Mi 5 flagship anytime soon, at least for this quarter."

A large physical button is spotted at the sides, which could be used to spring the camera into action.  The rear camera is always visible no matter what position its on but the front camera remains hidden until the slider is popped out. While it looks out of the norm, we simply don’t see any benefits of such approach considering the lens are still having a fixed position. At least on the OPPO N3, the rotating camera module is motorised, allowing you to take a hassle free panorama shots in either vertical or horizontal.  Perhaps the front of the smart phone looks cleaner this way but seriously nobody is complaining if there’s a selfie camera placed upfront.

Arif Lee,This may be the reason why Windows 10 is free to upgrade – it’s tracking your every move,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/04/this-may-be-the-reason-why-windows-10-is-free-to-upgrade-its-tracking-your-every-move/,"Download Windows 10,launch,microsoft,Microsoft Windows,Microsoft Windows 10,operating system,Upgrade Windows 10,Windows,Windows 10,Windows 10 Privacy,Windows 7,Windows 8,Windows 8.1","Industry in General,Microsoft,Mobile Devices,Others",2015-08-04,"Users are not going to like it, especially those who bought their copies.   is secretly selling your personal data, probably not even letting you know barring some fine print hidden in their T&Cs.

Microsoft has announced since   that Windows 10 would be free to upgrade, within one year of its launching for those running Windows 7, 8 and 8.1. One can draw a conclusion that their new strategy would be bombarding Windows 10 users with targeted ads. Verging on intrusive to say the least, Microsoft’s Windows 10 has fairly distrustful monitoring that includes watching your locational movements, any info from messages, calendars and even going through your contact list. Anyone who wants to dig deep into the   and  , feel free to do so but to simplify things, the OS will associate you to a unique advertising ID that is tied to your e-mail address. In turn, tailoring ads specific to your usage of your device. Usage of Cortana will further intensify the harvesting of your personal information. Though, the likeliness of you ever noticing this breech of privacy will be low, as it’ll appear in Windows Store apps – a newly launched venture that hasn’t picked up much traction, yet. As sinister as all this is, there are a handful of settings you can tweak to limit the amount of personal data leaking out on the inter-webs. 
 Officially, it’ll take a lot of tweaking and reading to fully understand what settings will exactly serve what purpose but if you’re absolutely sure about not wanting anything to get out, you can just set everything to “no”. The case is much easier for those who have yet to install Windows 10, just ensure you decline the “Express setting” and take your time to set the options yourself manually. Do ensure you refuse the OS or apps to access your location and turn off Cortana search. To those who went express and have Windows 10 already installed, just follow the easy how-to below.     Go to Settings > Privacy and individually go through the 13 tabs on the left. The “General” tab will have the most important settings to look at, while users should consider the calendar option, based on their intentions to use syncing of birthdays, scheduled appointments and so on.
 Cortana isn’t readily available in Malaysia yet but those who listed United States as their current location will have the feature enabled. As mentioned earlier in the article, Cortana will be one of the huge culprits when it comes to capturing information about you, so users should think wisely whether they truly need this application. 
 The following step is the most important one that affects your browser(s). Funny thing though, it’s located on an   under settings. It won’t be hard to miss but no one would expect Windows to add a hidden toggle switch in a place away from your computer settings. Just set both options to “Off”. It is a must to create a Microsoft account/use an existing one when setting up Windows 10, and the fact that you’re constantly signed on when using the OS.  
 The last step is quite extreme and it is only for those who are paranoid of anything going up to the cloud. You can opt to remove your Microsoft account entirely from Windows 10 and instead, use a local account. This action will limit features of the following: -synchronisation of settings across all PCs using the same account 
-authorisation from Windows Store and OneDrive To do so go to Settings > Accounts > select local account. For further reading on the subject head on over"

Locals won’t be disappointed with the device’s accompanying specs either – running a top of the line 64-bit Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 with graphics handled by the Adreno 430, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage that is expandable. The display is a Quad HD 5.2-inch that runs at 1440 x 2560 resolution display, pushing 565 pixels and protected by Gorilla Glass 3. Available only in Japan through NTT DoCoMo for roughly $750 after conversion, the Fujitsu Arrows NX F-04G is looking like an amazing phone, we only wish it was a global release."

The newest of the Sony line-up empathises innovations in the camera, design, and battery performance area of the device. Sony hopes to cement its place in the PROselfie category with the front and back 13-megapixel sensor and its near borderless 6-inch full HD display will aim to bring images that seem true to life. Offering the PROselfie feature akin to the C series, the Xperia C5 Ultra takes advantage of its twin 13-megapixel front and rear camera. Both shutters does auto focus and will include Sony’s signature Exmor RS sensor, HDR for stunning high-resolution pictures and video. Enhancing the PROselfie option is the Selfie Flash that is supported by the front camera: making sure there is enough light in the shot to showcase every inch of the photograph.  The lenses mentioned are also 22mm wide-angle lens, so it will be easier to cram more in each frame. The same images and video will be displayed on the huge 6-inch IPS display that is capable of Full HD and capitalises on Sony’s BRAVIA Engine 2, leaving the near borderless display fully ready to handle the most intrinsic detail in stills and videos. Coming in a variety of colours: black white and glossy soft mint, each has its own individual flare but all adorn an aluminium frame that allows the device to be sleek, stylish and ergonomic. Attesting to the “super mid-range” title, the Xperia C5 Ultra is no slouch in the processing area either, running a 1.7 GHz MediaTek Octa-core processor that is mated with 2 GB RAM and LTE enabled. The 2930 mAh battery is rated to last up to 7 hours and 47 minutes of video playback and users can further push their battery life with Ultra STAMINA mode. Memory hogs can take advantage of the expandable memory option, up to 200GB and the Sony device will be available in both single and dual SIM variants.   Expect to see the huge-screened Xperia C5 Ultra available in selected countries around the globe from mid-August onwards. We look forward to those PROselfie shots from everyone."

As part of their Merdeka promo, they are offering its newer PortaWiFi 2.0 device on a new plan with more data and at a lower monthly commitment. This is seen as a response to U Mobile’s   that gives you 12GB of data (off-peak + on-peak) from RM68/month.  For RM85/month (Normal: RM100/month), the new PortaWiFi Internet Plan gives you a total of 21GB which is split with 7GB of quota for all day use, and a remaining 14GB for use between 2AM to 8AM. If you can’t finish your monthly quota, Celcom even allows you to carry forward unused data up to 7GB from your all day allocation.  There are 2 PortaWiFi versions available – 4G LTE and 3G, but we recommend you go for the 4G version since it is offered for free with a 12 months contract. During sign up, you’ll need to pay RM50 for registration and RM50 for activation fee. If you’re taking the 4G LTE PortaWiFi 2.0, there’s an advance payment of RM220 required which will be rebated back (RM22/month) across 10 months into your monthly bills. So that’s a total of RM320 to pay when you pick up your new PortaWiFi device. As comparison, the previous PortaWiFi   4GB at RM68, 6GB at RM98 and 10GB and RM138. If you’re needing around 4GB to 7GB a month, the new offer is worth a look and the carry forward feature is a welcome bonus. In the previous PortaWiFi, the model itself requires a power source where you would need to plug it into a USB power adapter or through your car’s cigarette power outlet.

Instead, the Xperia M5 is dubbed as their “super mid-range” device and it carries one of the best mobile camera sensors Sony has to offer. On the exterior, it looks like a compact version of its Xperia Z3+ flagship especially the glossy bumpers on each corner. Like the newer waterproof Xperia models, it has IP68 rated resistance that allows you to submerge it under 1.5 metre deep of water for up to 30 minutes. And yes, the microUSB port is a capless design which makes charging hassle free. Like what   in the earlier leaks, the Xperia M5 gets a 5″ Full HD 1080p display and it uses glass for both front and back. Underneath it runs on MediaTek’s 2.0GHz Helio X10 octa-core processor with 3GB RAM, which is a similar combo with HTC’s flagship, the One M9+. The Xperia M5 also comes with an expandable microSD slot which can support today’s highest  .  The main camera is Sony’s newer 21.5MP   sensor with Hybrid Autofocus, which is better known as Phase Detection AF. With its quick 0.2 second focusing time, the Xperia M5 lets you take photos of fast moving objects with greater clarity. It shoot videos at 4K UHD resolution and it is further assisted with video stabilisation. The new sensor also lets you capture subjects clearly from afar with its 5X Clear Image Zoom.  For taking better selfies, the Xperia M5 gets a much larger 13MP camera in front which does auto focus. Keeping the lights on is a 2,600mAh capacity battery that’s rated to last up to 2 days and overall it weighs 143 grams with a thickness of 7.6mm. The Xperia M5 is available in White, Black and Gold colours, with availability starting from emerging markets in the middle of this month. If you’re looking for a compact flagship and find the 4.6″   too small, the Xperia M5 could be the compact flagship you’re looking for.  For more info, check out the   product page."

Of the two, the earlier Basic 38 offers better value for less.  Should you exceed your monthly voice and SMS allocation, extra usage will be charged at RM0.20/minute or RM0.20 per SMS. For extra high-speed data, it offers the same data top-up rates as before with 1GB going for RM15 or 5GB at RM50/month.  When compared to the competition, it is still no match to U Mobile’s   postpaid plan in terms of value. At least it is better than   that offers 2GB of data which is split into off-peak and on-peak timeslots."

A thread on Reddit has brought us to the attention of Windows automatically using your PC to seed Windows updates to the world. Yes, the whole world. This issue will pose problems especially to those with home internet packages that are capped with a fixed high-speed download quota. So how do you disable or limit this seeding in particular? You have three options that you are free to choose from: disable seeding entirely, limit to computers in your local network (one internet connection source only, like your house) or leave it as it is. Luckily Windows allows this and users can follow this step by step tutorial below: 1. Go to Settings > Update & Security 
 2.  Windows Update > Advanced Options 3. From advanced options go to “Choose how updates are delivered” 
 4. From “Choose how updates are delivered” you can choose the following options: Turn off P2P transfer entirely or limit to transfer to PCs on your local network.

From the looks of it, this could be Samsung’s first flagship device with dual-SIMs that’s going to be sold officially in Malaysia. 
 If you’re unconvinced, the Galaxy Note series usually carry the “SM-N9″ prefix for its model number. The Galaxy Note 3 for example is known as the SM-9005 while its cheaper Note 3 Neo carries the SM-N750 code. Meanwhile the Galaxy Note 4 for Malaysia (Exynos Version) carries the model number SM-910C while its Note edge version is also known as the SM-N915F. This isn’t the first time Samsung has made a DUOS version of its high-end device and there are a number of grey-import Galaxy S6 sold here with dual-SIM support.  A quick search on Google also reveals that the same model is a Galaxy Note 5 variant for the   and   market.

Even the upcoming   and the recently launched Mi Note in Malaysia comes with dual-SIM and 4G LTE support as well. Since dual-SIMs have become a standard offering for low to mid-spec smart phones, it does make sense for Samsung to offer dual-SIM flagships as its consumers graduates to a more upmarket model.

The OS will be free for those who currently have a valid copy of Windows 7, 8 or 8.1. Microsoft has stepped up since receiving harsh criticism in 2012, as the newest version now has the simple but taken for granted “start” button – now including live tiles and a more extensive menu. This doesn’t just stop there, with innovations that include your own digital personal assistant, Cortana, Hello – a biometric authentication program, an Xbox app, plus their new browser, Microsoft Edge. Users can expect this to be the greatest version of Windows yet, having been in beta testing the longest. This is to ensure delivery of a service tried and trusted and will be kept automatically up-to-date with tweaks and security updates throughout its lifetime. Utilising cross-platform connectivity which is a necessity in today’s world, the latest version will become available on a broad range of devices that range from PCs, tablets, phones, Raspberry Pi, Xbox One, and HoloLens to name a few. Microsoft envisions a new era that is built around feedback from 5 million fans world-wide, quoting Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Windows and Devices Group, at Microsoft.

The figures for this year stand at a downward 7% based on yearly figures, accounting for 44.7 million tablets worldwide. Possibly, hampered by the rise of other manufacturers that have successfully played catch-up. Front-runners, Apple and Samsung are seeing less of the overall market, from 45% of majority during the first quarter of the year, eventually dropping a combined 41% – due to the rise of LG, Huawei and Lenovo. So why are we seeing a dip? Well for one, it could be due to a gradual lack of innovations in the hardware department – the likes of the   2 to 3 comes to mind, as additions of the Touch ID being the only big difference and costing an incredible $100 more for only this feature. Not only specific to Apple, Microsoft’s Surface line has had its issues in its early beginnings but after the slow start, sales seemed to pick up and allow Windows to make a   ($713 million in revenue) thanks to the  . These earnings though, do not include the numbers from the Pro’s younger brother ( ), which could’ve given a boost to Microsoft. A case can be made for longer life cycles being a part of the tablet’s demise. Users are relying on their current generation tablets more, and foregoing the newer ones as they don’t bring much more to the table. That and considering the emergence of the phablet, which could seem more appealing to some to don’t quite have the budget for two devices. Needless to say, 2-in-1s and convertibles are also paving a way into the tablet’s market share. A lot of tough competition for a device that sits at a very narrow edge of a cliff.

The news surfaces from Samsung’s Tizen Developer Summit 2015 held in Bangalore, India.

Cheryl Bates,Sony Xperia Z3+ First Impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/29/sony-xperia-z3-first-impressions-2/,"Sony,Sony Xperia Z3,Sony Xperia Z3 Plus,sony xperia z3 plus hands on,sony xperia z3 plus launch malaysia,Sony Xperia Z3 Plus Malaysia","Mobile Devices,Sony",2015-07-29,"Despite the phone seeing its entry into the Malaysian market a good month or so ago, we finally get to try out the   in the flesh. The phone is essentially an updated version of the waterproof   that’s skinnier, lighter than it’s counterpart and has a bare microUSB port. On the surface the Xperia Z3+ shares a lot in common with its sibling, sharing a very similar styling complete with fingerprint magnet glossy finish. It is a fair bit lighter and thinner than its counterpart, being 6.9mm thin as opposed to the 7.3mm thickness of the Xperia Z3.  Its also just 8 grams lighter than its sibling but since both phones are already very light you don’t entirely feel the difference. However the battery has also been given the skinny treatment and has a slightly smaller capacity at 2,930mAh as opposed to the former’s 3,100mAh, but Sony claims that it will last for two entire days thanks to software tweaks. We won’t know for certain how long the battery will really last till we get to do some real world tests on the unit. To recap the specs, the dual-SIM smartphone has a octa-core Snapdragon 810 under the hood that’s mated to 3GB RAM. It has the same 5.2 inch Full HD display as its sibling, alongside dual front stereo speakers and built in Hi-Res audio capabilities. As far as storage is concerned you get 32GB out of the box, but this can be bumped up to 128GB via the microSD slot. It will also similarly support PlayStation remote play with your PlayStation 4. The cameras on the other hand are mostly as what’s on the Xperia Z3, namely a 20.7 megapixel snapper with a 5 megapixel front shooter for the selfie centric. So no changes here save for the front camera getting an upgrade from 2 megapixel. It will also run Android Lollipop out of the box skinned with Sony’s latest UI. As far as looks are concerned, both phones have the same glass and metal design with the exception of the Xperia Z3+ having added plastic “bumpers” on the edges of the smartphone, possibly to prevent damage and dings that were common on the prior model. They still feature that glossy fingerprint magnet rear cover as well. For now Malaysia will only have the Black and Copper versions available, with the White and Aqua Green options to become available at a later date. Personally we’ve mostly liked Sony’s style direction but its about time they went for something other than the glossy glass backing for their premium smartphones. The ports have been given some updates as well, with the biggest change being that the USB slot has been moved to the bottom of the device and is now capless to make charging a lot simpler. The SIM slot has been moved to the other side of the device but still remains capped, but since it is not something you will be regularly opening up it shouldn’t be an issue."

In the previous  , it was quite an average flagship device with a 5.2″ Full HD display and a Snapdragon 801 processor that’s powered by a rather small 2,300mAh capacity battery. For 2015, Motorola is trying to cover all segments above the   with a mid-range 5.5″ Moto X Play and a higher-spec 5.7″ Moto X Style. What are the differences between the two? Read on to find out.  
Among the two, the Moto X Style (or   in the US) is their top of the line offering with a huge 5.7″ Quad HD (2560×1440) display and it runs on a Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor that’s currently powering the  . It is mated to 3GB of RAM and comes with a choice of 32GB or 64GB of storage. Unlike the previous 2nd gen model, the new Moto X gets a microSD slot which accepts up to 128GB capacity. For better audio playback, it also gets a pair of front firing stereo speakers.  For imaging, it gets a high-resolution 21MP f/2.0 main camera that shoots 4K videos while the front sports a 5MP f/2.0 shooter that has its own flash light. In terms of connectivity, it gets Bluetooth 4.1 LE, WiFi 802.11ac MIMO support, NFC and 4G LTE Cat 6 with speeds up to 300Mbps. It isn’t submergeable but the Moto X Style gets a nano coating repellent that’s IP52 certified. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery that supports Turbo Charging. 
Moving down a notch, is the Moto X Play which offers a 5.5″ Full HD (1920×1080) display and a mid-range Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor that’s mated to just 2GB of RAM. For storage, it gets a smaller 16GB or 32GB options with room for more via its microSD expansion slot. The main camera is also a 21MP shooter with dual-tone LED flash but the front gets a more basic 5MP camera.  Connectivity is also a step back with Bluetooth 4.0 LE, WiFi up to 802.11n but it still supports 4G LTE which probably is only up to Cat4 (150Mbps). Despite being positioned lower, it gets a larger 3,630mAh battery which is rated to last 30 hours with mixed use. As you would expect, both Moto Xs are running on the latest Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box. In terms of  , the top notch Moto X Play is going for 299 Pounds (about RM1,776) while the Moto X Style is priced from 359 Pounds (about RM2,132) in the UK. For the US, the Moto X Style that’s called the   is priced from US$399.99 (about RM1,522) for the 16GB version.

Under the hood is the latest Qualcomm octa-core Snapdragon 810 v2.1 processor mated to a top of the line 4GB LD-DDR4 RAM, which should make it quite a monster in the performance department.

As for the camera, you will get a 13 megapixel f/2.0 rear snapper with laser focus and Optical Image Stabilisation as well as a 5 megapixel selfie cam up front.

Running on a stock operating system, it gets early access to the latest software updates and it feels very smooth to use despite having low to mid-range hardware.  With the rise of affordable and decent smart phones in the market, can the Moto G step up its game to maintain its relevance? We could probably say yes thanks to some minor tweaks that make quite a difference. The Moto G in its 3rd iteration now gets a subtle tweak especially at the back where it gets a redesigned camera and Motorola logo placement. The front is still a compact 5″ display that’s perfect for single handed use and the screen resolution remains unchanged at 1280×720 resolution.  To withstand the elements, the front glass is toughen with Gorilla Glass 3 and this time, the Moto G comes with IPX7 water resistant. This protects the device from accidental splashes or drops into the pool as it can withstand being submerged up to 1 metre of fresh water for up to 30 minutes.  Under the hood, it gets an updated mid-range Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 processor but it runs on a higher 1.4GHz. As comparison, the Redmi 2 and Galaxy A5 are powered by a similar processor but on a lower 1.2GHz clock speed. Usually the Moto G settles for a measly 1GB of RAM with 8GB of storage but now it gets an additional high-spec option of 2GB RAM with 16GB of storage. If that’s not enough, there’s also a microSD slot that accepts up to 32GB of extra storage. The Moto G has always been mediocre when it comes to photography but this time it receives an upgraded 13MP f/2.0 shooter that supports Auto HDR, Slow Mo and it records full HD videos. For better lighting it is assisted by dual-tone LED flash and you can even launch the camera app instantly by just simply twisting your wrist. Knowing that people love taking selfies, the front camera gets a more up to date 5MP f/2.2 shooter with a wide 72 degree field of view.  Powering the device is a larger 2,470mAh capacity battery which they say is enough to pull through 24 hours of use in a single charge. It supports 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, WiFi 802.11n and if you’re wondering, it still doesn’t support NFC. At time of release, it runs on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop and it will definitely receives Android M once it is available.

Alexander Wong,Samsung introduces a 16MP CMOS Sensor based on 1.0 micron pixels,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/29/samsung-introduces-a-16mp-cmos-sensor-based-on-1-0-micron-pixels/,"1.0 micron camera sensor,1.0 micron pixel size,ISOCELL,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 camera,Samsung ISOCELL,Samsung S5K3P3","Mobile Devices,Samsung",2015-07-29,"As smart phones get better in photography, the protruding camera bumps are unavoidable these days. This is due to size constraints of its camera sensor that’s harder to fit on ultra-thin designs. With Samsung being a major player in the semiconductor business, they have just announced the industry’s first 1.0 micron pixel based 16MP CMOS Image Sensor for mobile devices.  The Samsung S5K3P3 image sensor utilises their own   that was first featured on the Galaxy S5. This helps reduce crosstalk between nearby pixels and it helps to increase light sensitivity as well.  As a result, the new 16MP sensor is tinier than other 16MP image sensors in the market with up to 20% reduction in height. This allows smart phone designers to create a ultra-thin device with less protruding lenses without compromising on image quality. Samsung reckons that it will produce images that are on par with other 1.2 micron based image sensors in the market. As comparison, the IMX240 sensor that’s being used on the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S6, is still based on 1.2 micron pixel size. Meanwhile the popular IMX214 13MP Sony Sensor that’s used by majority of flagship smart phones is has a pixel size of 1.12 micron.  Looking at the timing of the announcement, this compact 16MP Samsung image sensor could find its way onto the upcoming   that’s launching on 13th August. However from the earlier   that we saw, the Galaxy Note 5 still has a camera bump but it doesn’t seem to protrude as much as the current Galaxy S6/S6 edge. Camera bumps or not, what really matters is if it takes good shots with minimal fuss. As  , the 16MP Sony IMX240 is a stellar performer and that’s the benchmark to beat for this new in-house developed sensor."

As comparison, the previous m1 runs on a MediaTek MT6732 procesor with 4 cores running at 1.5GHz.  The biggest change is the amount of RAM and storage it brings, with 2GB of LPDDR3-RAM and 16GB of high performance eMMC 5.0 storage. If you need to store more photos and videos, it accepts microSD cards up to 128GB. Take note that the microSD slot is shared with the 2nd SIM tray slot of this dual-SIM 4G LTE device. The choice of cameras remain unchanged with a 13MP f/2.2 main camera while the front gets 5MP f/2.0 unit.

Capitalising on capturing the public roads in East Malaysia, to further enhance the imagery of the motorways for locals, the feature is now live. The beginning of the roll-out will publish roughly 80 percent of stills found in Sabah and Sarawak’s public roads, including – important highways, roads with tolls, state roads and urban centres that took 6 months. Notably the images that Google captured involved some off-road excursions that was captured with their Street View Trekker, a harnessed backpack-mounted camera system. East Malaysia is no slouch in this category either, with special panoramic images of a UNESCO world heritage site famous for its limestone karst formations;  . Google took advantage of the wearable backpack camera system and managed to add Mulu National Park to the list of others: Taman Negara, Pangkor and Langkawi. Giving glimpses of these beautiful locations might just give tourist and locals the push they need to visit the sites. Managing Director of Google Malaysia, Vietnam and Philippines – Sajith Sivanandan, announced that the Street View Imagery Launch allows Malaysians to have a more experience-filled time that takes usability, comprehensiveness and enjoyment to a new level. To find the Street View feature, users will notice the familiar orange “Pegman” that’s located on the bottom right-hand side of the map and drag the icon onto any blue highlighted street. Google has always been prompt to address any issues regarding privacy and Street View Imagery’s highly sophisticated technology makes faces and license plates blurred to keep identities anonymous. To add, Google also has a system that allows users to request additional blurring of images that feature them or something of importance. Request for the following can be made easily with the “report a problem” tool that is readily available on the bottom right corner of Google Maps."

Pretty bold claims from the Chinese outfit, seeing that it is only the beginning of Q3 for 2015. Updates on the AnTuTu benchmarks proves some promising news on purported 3 variants of the OnePlus 2. Having earlier showing up on the same benchmarks with 2 other scores: 51,460 and chart-topping 63,700 for the heating-riddled Snapdragon 810. The latest scores however port at 49,221, which leads to speculation that there are more than 1 model to be released tomorrow. Part 1 Part 2 The same AnTuTu scores exhibit different specifications, when looking at the resolution of the screen(s) – further fuelling us to believe that OnePlus may indeed launch a lower-spec model that is supposed to have a 1080 x 1920 resolution screen.  , on the other hand, states that the same 5.5-inch screen will push a higher 1440 x 2560 resolution. So far, it isn’t quite far-fetched to conclude the validity of the leaks as yet another benchmark test, the GFX Bench affirmed the amount of RAM (4GB) that was announced by co-founder Carl Pei, himself. This is amid other reports have been going around – in reference to 3 different listings by Bluetooth Special Interest Group that confirms the models: A2001, A2003 and A2005. All 3 were certified with a hardware version 2.2 and software version 2.01 for the newest Bluetooth 4.1 technology. There seems to be an overlap and inconsistency in terms of these leaks but with only tomorrow’s morning away, we might as well wait it out and see if there’s any potential in the OnePlus 2 being the “2016 Flagship Killer” Although, if you want to wait in anticipation tune into the play by play of the announcement, feel free to download the VR Launch app  , provided you have a VR Cardboard.

Samsung has officially announced its next Unpacked event which is going to be held just slightly more than 2 weeks from now. The Galaxy Note series which has been traditionally announced during   in Berlin is currently held a month earlier in a bid to maximise its sales potential ahead of Apple’s upcoming announcement.  The launch will be streamed live as usual on their Samsung Mobile   and it is happening at 11:00AM EDT which is at 11:00PM Malaysian Time.  Samsung is expected to announce 2 phablets – the   and the  , both of which   by Singapore’s certification body recently. Following the  , the new models will feature a similar metal and glass body construction and we’ve seen several   confirming this approach. In terms of specs, the new Note 5 is expected to run on its newer all-in-one Exynos chip which is mated with 4GB of RAM. Instead of a Note “Edge” variant, the second device would be the S6 edge+, which is a larger and enhanced version of its current Galaxy S6 edge. While it looks the same on the outside, word has it that it will carry 4GB of RAM, a likely updated processor as well as a bigger battery capacity to power up its larger screen. Unfortunately for power users, we expect the new models to come without a removable battery and expandable microSD slot like its current Galaxy S6/S6 edge models.  If Samsung wants to outdo Apple in sales, they should be selling this fairly quickly and word has it that it could go to market as early as 21st August. We’ll find out for sure in a couple of weeks time. Wondering what to expect with the next Galaxy Note 5? You can check our  ."

Some are speculating that the new version will feature a stylus auto-eject feature which not only makes it cleaner to stow but feels more tactile to take out when you need it. Based on the latest images from  , taking out the S-Pen stylus is no different from the current Note 4 or its predecessors. While it looks more flush with its metal frame, there’s an exposed portion at the side which gives enough room for you to pry it out with your fingernails. Do note that these are just alleged prototypes and the final product might be different from what is shown here.  With the latest flagships like the S6 and S6 edge sporting premium materials, the S-Pen might get a redesign with matching metallic colours. A Gold Platinum colour S-Pen is shown below and the top has a metallic end while the mid-section maintains a secondary button.   The S-Pen on the Galaxy Note 4 marks a huge improvement over its previous stylus with 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity and it gets heaps of productivity features out of the box. What will Samsung do next to improve its S-Pen? We’ll find out in a couple of weeks time as the Note 5 and S6 edge+ are expected to be announced as early as 12th August."

Previously when 3GB seemed a lot, Samsung just might be considering to add the   to the ever-growing list. The rumoured S6 edge+ has picked up a lot of pace recently, as August is around the corner. There is a strong possibility the 4GB slot in Samsung’s line-up will be two-fold come August the 12  (rumoured release date), as the Note 5 is also said to have the same RAM internals. No surprise here, as currently in the market, other players have already equip their phones with the same 4GB of RAM – Asus Zenfone 2, Lenovo K80, and Xiaomi Mi Note Pro. Supposedly, the same rumour also mentions the mobile devices’ battery (3000 mAh), along with Samsung’s signature Exynos 7420 processor. With bumps in the current RAM (3GB) and battery (2600 mAh) compared to its little sibling, the S6 edge, the likeliness of it costing more would be a safe assumption. Just to give a rough idea of how much it’ll cost, here’s the pricing breakdown of the S6 edge and similarly sized iPhone 6 Plus locally: With prices that look like that, more RAM & battery could mean a significant hit to its price-point.

In response to these affordable sub-RM40 plans, Maxis is now introducing its MaxisGO postpaid with 2GB of data at RM48/month. That’s not all as it also includes 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS each month. So is this better than its   plan with 2GB/month? Wait until you read the fine lines. For starters, the 2GB data quota is split into 2 buckets – 1GB which you can use for the whole day and another 1GB that’s restricted for off peak use between 2am – 7am. Strangely while you can sign up for the plan now, the off peak data  is only available effective 30 July 2015. For the bundled 100 minutes calls and 100 SMS each month, it is applicable for all networks in Malaysia. Another difference is the top up cost of data should you need more than just 1GB (all day). An extra 500MB costs RM38 and 1GB costs RM48, which is the price of the full subscription fee itself. As comparison, Maxis charges just   on its SurfMore plans. So if data is more important to you, you’re better off with their current SurfMore 50 plan.  In summary, this is for the light data users who need more calls and SMS than the average data-centric user. If you’re on SurfMore 50 plan, this makes sense if you make quite a significant number of calls and you hardly use 1GB of data each month. In addition, there’s no additional charge should you exceed your data allocation and you’re also entitled to enjoy RM38/day roaming at their supported 106 countries. For info, head over to   page."

Dubbed as the 2016 flagship killer, it carries a lot of expectations and most fans are hoping they could keep the price as low as its   predecessor.  OnePlus aims to give the best specs they could possibly offer while maintaining an optimal user experience. They have also thrown in a couple of new features which are among the first to be fitted on an Android smart phone.  For starters, the front of the OnePlus 2 is a similar 5.5″ screen size that pushes the same full HD 1080p resolution as the One. However it has been much improved with a brighter in-cell IPS display that’s viewable under harsh sunlight and it boast a higher 1500:1 contrast ratio. This offers better blacks and bolder colours. The OnePlus 2 has an aluminium alloy frame and the back comes with its signature sandstone black colour. For a touch of personalisation, there will be StyleSwap covers which are sold separately as well. Under the hood, it gets the latest Qualcomm Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 v2.1 processor with a top of the line 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. Like the previous model, you get the option of either 16GB or 64GB storage options which isn’t expandable with microSD. The OnePlus 2 this time around supports dual-SIMs (nano) with 4G LTE. For imaging it gets a 13MP f/2.0 camera with 1.3 micron size pixels and it is assisted by laser focus and Optical Image Stabilisation. In the camera app, it allows you to take super resolution photos up to 50MP and slow motion videos up to 120fps. The front however gets a 5MP camera for selfies.  Powering the device is a 3,300mAh capacity battery which is now charged with a reversible USB Type C, the latest standard for mobile devices. If you want to use your existing chargers, you can do so with an add-on accessory. Another new addition is a fingerprint scanner at the front which registers up to 5 fingers and it claims to respond quicker than iPhone’s Touch ID.  On top of that, you also get better controls over your notifications with its Alert Slider. This is similar to the silent switch on the iPhone but you get 3 settings (e.g. full notification, priority, off).  Out of the box, the OnePlus 2 runs on its own OxygenOS that’s still based on Android Lollipop. However it offers a couple of Android M features including permission and notification management on the app level.  In terms of availability, it will hit the US, Canada, India, Europe and China markets on 11th August. For the rest of us in South East Asia, we would need to wait until Q4 which is a few months from now. OnePlus will still be using the invitation system but they would allocate more units this time around with priority given to its loyal forum members.  The OnePlus 2 is priced at US$329 for the 16GB model and US$389 for the 64GB version, which is roughly RM1,256 and RM1,485 respectively in our current exchange rate. As comparison, the current OnePlus One 64GB is going for RM1,199 which is currently sold exclusively via Maxis. For the OnePlus 2, Maxis could still be the exclusive telco but we’ll have to wait and see in the next few months to come.

Like the S6 and S6 edge, the Galaxy Note 5 will come with striking metallic colours which reflects light to give a shimmering effect. The design language is the same as well with the use of a metallic frame and it looks like a reverse version of the S6 edge with the slopping lines aligned towards the back. It also gets a protruding camera lens with its LED flash and heart rate sensor placed right next to it. The top looks clean and surprisingly they omitted the infrared blaster and all you get is a nano SIM tray slot and a secondary mic. Looking at the bottom end, you’ll find a headphone jack, microUSB port, a speaker grill and mic as well as an S-Pen silo. Both sides appears to be clean with just the typical volume rockers and power button visible. Unless Samsung is doubling up its SIM tray slot for a microSD card option, it looks like there isn’t any expandable storage and removable battery for the Galaxy Note 5. Like the S6, storage should come with a minimum of 32GB with larger options being offered at selected markets. In terms of specs, it is expected to retain its 5.7″ Quad HD display and underneath it runs on a newer Exynos 7422 that’s mated with 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM.

The Galaxy Note series which is often launched during IFA in Berlin annually, will be seeing an earlier launch this year as early as 12th/13th August.  Unlike last year where they have launched the   along with its curve display  , Samsung will be introducing its   productivity phablet that comes with an S-Pen and the  , which is a   of its current double curve screen smart phone. The model names   and now we finally get to see the devices in its full glory thanks to a couple of fresh leaks. As expected, the Galaxy Note 5 continues Samsung’s new premium approach with the use of metal and glass like its current S6 flagship. Directly from the front, it looks like a Note 4 but the bezels are noticeably thinner and it looks like it carries a similar 5.7″ screen that’s going to be pushing Quad HD resolution. A metal frame is visible and you can see some antenna bands in white at the top and bottom of the device. The home button looks identical with the s6 which undoubtedly come with a one touch fingerprint sensor. So far there’s no pictures of the back but we reckon it will feature a glass with shimmering metal appearance underneath. In terms of specs, the Note 5 will feature its top of the line offering and this time the processor could be a new all-in-one chip solution that houses the CPU, RAM, Storage, GPU and radio antennas. Their current Exynos 7420 chip on the S6/S6 edge is enjoying its   benchmarks and the new one is expected to raise the bar higher. Like most new flagship smart phones launched lately, the Note 5 is likely to come with 4GB RAM.   The S6 edge+ is not much of a surprise really as it retains the exact same design as the current S6 edge but it is slightly wider and taller. Underneath, it will get the same specs and if you missed it, you can check out some   comparison shots of both models. On the hardware side, it is the same as the S6 edge but you can probably expect a larger battery capacity to power up a larger screen for longer hours.  Both models could go on sale as early as end of August and Samsung is expecting its early release would give them a better chance to sell more devices ahead of Apple’s new iPhone that’s going to be announced in a few months time. In the last 3 months of 2014, Apple has   than Samsung and that’s when the Galaxy Note 4 has hit the ground running.

With their Galaxy Note series of phablets doing rather well it’s a wonder that they are still interested in producing a similar product the tablet segment. The latest member of the family is none other than the Samsung Galaxy Tab A; a new range of tablets that supports telephony features with the productivity of an S Pen. Generally the tablet looks like one geared towards users looking for productivity with a little bit of entertainment thrown into the mix, considering the specs are decent enough to get some gaming in or hash out your daily report if you aren’t the sort to drag your laptop about.  But how does the tablet actually measure up, especially when there are cheaper tablets that are capable better, like its direct competitor the Xiaomi Mi Pad? Let’s find out. The Galaxy Tab A comes in 2 sizes – a compact 8 incher or a full sized 9.7 inch unit. For this review, we’re given the Galaxy Tab A 8.0 in dark grey. As far as the looks go, the tablet is very similar to the  in terms of sharing the same material design and feel. However the Tab A is mostly built out of plastic with a rounded metal rim on the face of the device, it does a decent job in looking premium at the very least. The Tab A isn’t the thinnest or the lightest though with the tablet being 7.5mm thick at its thinnest point and weighing in at about 338g, it’s rather substantial. The tablet is priced at RM 1,299 which is hardly cheap with all the sub RM 1,000 tablets there are running around in the market; with the roughly similar Mi Pad retailing for just RM 799 though it cannot make phone calls nor does it come with a versatile pen."

At the moment, we are just getting the standard Mi Note and not their top of the line Mi Note Pro that comes with a Quad HD display, Snapdragon 810 processor and 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM.

For the Malaysian market we are getting 64GB of internal storage which is non expandable. Like its new flagships, the Mi Note gets dual-SIM (micro-SIM + nano-SIM) support with 4G LTE connectivity.

Eager buyers will be pleased to know that we are only 5 days away from the virtual reality themed launch by the Chinese smartphone manufacturer. Finally, the photo gives OnePlus fans a visualisation of their possible next device. Front-side there are no odd mentions, other than the large finger print sensor/potential home button on the bottom, a new addition opposed to the older OnePlus. It seems that metal wraps around the devices edges of the OnePlus 2 and nothing to shout about regarding the right side of the phone though, where three of the usual buttons live – volume rockers and power button. However, there is a new inclusion on the left, which could very well be a dedicated camera button. Making up the back, in terms of texture, it looks similarly to the type of material used on the previous sandstone black model. A familiar camera model is placed lower this time around, and below that as well is what could be a laser autofocus module – giving some substantiation to OnePlus’ said emphasis on the camera on its newest device. Entrusted to give fans a preview of the device’s camera prowess,   gave us an in-depth look at how the lens performs, as seen below. A steady slew of specifications have already been confirmed, such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, USB Type-C connector and a 3,300 mAh battery. The TENAA certification also lists a 5.5″ Quad HD display (2560×1440 resolution), 32GB of storage and 13MP + 8MP camera combos. While these beefy insides would raise concerns to the budget-friendly, OnePlus maintains that it will cost less than 450 USD and yet still include a finger-print sensor that is most probably taking advantage of Android M’s compatibility. We hope all those sitting at home have their OnePlus Cardboards’ at the ready, for the official launching: if you haven’t yet, find someone who does, cause it’s been sold out since it first went on sale."

This is similar to what Maxis’  , Xpax’s   and Digi’s new   has to offer. But is that it? If U Mobile wants to shake up the industry, they have got to offer more than just free throttled internet. Ahead of its launch tomorrow, we managed to get a glimpse of U Mobile’s new prepaid plan and let’s just say that it could put even some postpaid plans to shame. 
 The new U Mobile prepaid not only offers free basic internet like the rest but it probably gives the most free high-speed data in the industry. A SIM pack costs RM8.50 and it comes with RM5 of credit with 10 days validity.  With just a one time minimum top up of RM10, U Mobile grants you 1GB of data for every 30 days for LIFE! Of course, this is provided that your prepaid account is active with regular top ups. As comparison, #MagicSIM gives 10MB and one day validity of free high speed data for every RM1 you top up. So a RM30 reload would give you 300MB that’s valid for 30 days inclusive of a couple of free calls or SMS. In terms of call rates, U Mobile charges a low 5 sen/30 seconds (10sen/min) and 8 sen/SMS, both of which are applicable to all networks. Upon activation, you get 200MB of high-speed data with the starter pack. In addition, they are giving up to 450 minutes of free calls to U Mobile users every month but subject to certain conditions which isn’t mentioned from the image above.  The launch is happening tomorrow so stay tuned as we update more details including its data top ups and other perks that might come included with this new affordable prepaid.

Eager owners can choose between an Ivory White and Midnight Blue, while the innards are beefed up by a bi-metallic frame to improve sturdiness. The 7.65 mm slate, allows photo-enthusiast and amateurs alike to fully take charge with a slew of features accompanying the rear 8 megapixel and 5 megapixel front shutters. The lenses comes in at a f/2.2 aperture lens along with the ability of slow shutter, audio photo, double exposure and other notable OPPO camera features. Its big brother definitely comes up tops, as the R1x is equip with an f/2.0 sensor for the 13 megapixel rear and 5 megapixel front. Hardware wise, a 64 bit 1.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 Quad-core processor powers this nifty phone, and is helped along by 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage that is expandable to 128 GB with a micro SD card. This sits well below the Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615, of the R1x. The screen however is a mere 960 x 540 5-inch display, that sits just well enough, considering it’ll be priced lower than the OPPO R1x: that pushes higher pixels – 1280 x 720, in its 5-inch IPS HD panel. Battery on the other hand, stands at 2420 mAh – non-removable. Going along the trend of allowing users to use two SIMs, OPPO does the same for the Mirror 5."

In the face of  , Samsung still thinks there’s still a market for premium tablets and the new one now comes with a 4:3 display aspect ratio that’s similar to the iPad Air and iPad mini series. For starters, it will come in 2 sizes, 8.0″ and 9.7″ inches, which is similar to what its   has to offer. The display on both models are using Super AMOLED with a resolution of 2048×1536 pixels. While that’s the same as what iPad Retina Displays have to offer, it is lower than the current Galaxy Tab S which gives a higher Quad HD 2600×1600 pixels resolution.  In terms of design, this is Samsung’s thinnest and lightest tablets at only 5.6mm thick and it weighs from just 265 grams for the 8.0″ WiFi only model. It gets a premium metal frame around the sides like its current flagship smart phones and the home button also features a one touch fingerprint scanner. Under the hood, it gets an Exynos 5433 Octa-Core processor (Quad 1.9GHz + Quad 1.3GHz) that’s mated with 3GB of RAM. Storage wise, you get either 32GB of 64GB on-board and thankfully it still gets a microSD slot supporting up to 128GB.  For imaging, it gets a 8MP AF main camera and a front facing 2.1MP unit which is isn’t much to shout about.  Battery wise, the 9.7″ is juiced up with a 5,870mAh capacity unit while the 8.0″ version gets 4,000mAh. As comparison, the previous model had a larger battery at 7,900mAh (Tab S 10.5) and 4,900mAh (Tab S 8.4).  Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop and both sizes will be offered in both WiFi only and 4G LTE variants depending on selected markets. There’s no S-Pen, so if you fancy to scribble something on the go, the Galaxy Tab A is your only choice at the moment. If we can summarise, the Galaxy Tab S2 offers better specs and materials but it sacrifices on display and battery. In terms of price, the Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 is listed at 399 Euro (about RM1,643) for WiFi and 469 Euro (about RM1,931) for LTE, while the larger 9.7″ version is going for 499 Euro (about RM2,055) for WiFi and 569 Euro (about RM2,343) for LTE. Both models are expected to go on sale globally starting next month in August. As usual, it comes with a variety accessories including a keyboard that hooks on with matching colours."

The message is vague by saying “move 4 to double” but the outline of the image clearly shows a shaded outline of a “3” and many will jump to the conclusion that the match sticks that make up the 6 can easily be rearranged to a “2”. In timely fashion, the 32GB capacity device could land during India’s celebration of Xiaomi’s anniversary, the 22  of July – a day from now. At the beginning of the product launch, those who were interested were left with a bad taste in their mouth due to the lack of external storage and a disappointingly low internal memory of 16GB. As the device might receive a bump in the storage department, it’s highly unlikely that there will be changes in the original Mi 4i spec sheet, which include a 5-inch IPS display that is full HD ready (1920 x 1080 pixels), a second-gen Octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor clocked at 1.7GHz, mated with 2GB of RAM and a 13-megapixel rear + 5 megapixel front camera lens. Powering all of this is a 3,120 mAh battery and supplementing the cellular connectivity is a dual SIM option, LTE supported. For more info regarding the RM 749 priced Mi 4i be sure to check out our review   and while there is no official pricing mentioned, if there’s a release of the 32 GB model, it would be roughly an increase of RM 150 +- given that the   pricing increase hovers around the same mark. Malaysians will have to wait to see if we’ll receive the 32GB variant on our shores but be sure to be on the look-out following the anniversary in India."

A dummy set of the 3rd gen Moto G for 2015 was spotted and it comes with the usual key selling features sticker at the front. Interestingly there’s an IPX7 icon which means it will be more water resistant than before.  While the icon indicates that it is resistant to rain, the   means that it has been certified to be submerged under 1 metre of water and for up to 30 minutes. This is similar to the HTC   that’s water resistant out of the box without the use of extra casing. Of course, it is also subject to the brand’s faith on its water resistance as we’ve seen how the Galaxy S5 and even the Apple Watch being discouraged from underwater use despite having sufficient resistance on paper.  Just to recap on what we know so far about the Moto G, it will retain most of the same specs as the previous model with a couple of updated tweaks. The front display is still a 5 incher with HD 720p resolution and it will run on a newer Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 processor with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage which can be expanded with microSD.

If that’s not convincing enough, both models have just passed certification in Singapore’s IDA database with the Galaxy Note 5 carrying the model number SM-N920I while the Galaxy S6 edge+ having the number SM-G928I. At least now we can confirm the product names and there will be a larger   instead of a   replacement with an S-Pen. In terms of design, both the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ would carry over its premium glass and metal unibody approach just like its current Galaxy S6/S6 edge.

Spec-wise the Galaxy Note 5 will get a 5.67″ Quad HD display and under the hood, it could be running on their latest Exynos all-in-one chip that integrates its Octa-Core processor, RAM, storage, GPU and modem in a single unit. As you would expect from a brand new flagship, it will come with 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. It is also rumoured to carry a 4,100mAh battery, which is a huge upgrade from the current Note 4.

Antutu has just released a summary of top performance devices for the first half of 2015 where the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge occupies the top 2 spots with over 60,000 points, followed by Xiaomi’s   at over 57,000 points. The Mi Note Pro is the highest performing Snapdragon 810 smart phone to date, and it uses the latest V2.1 processor version with better cooling and it is mated to 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM.

At the moment, only the Exynos 7420 processor on the S6/S6 edge has managed to break the 60,000 barrier which accounts to 20% share of top performing devices tested on Antutu. Qualcomm’s former flagship processor, the Snapdragon 805 also takes up 20% share on Antutu. The new MediaTek MT6795 processor which currently powers the HTC One M9+ holds just 10%, while Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 810 holds the biggest share at 50%. Looking at the trend throughout the past few years, 2015 marks an exponential growth in top-line performance where we see a jump of nearly 20,000 points from 2014. As comparison, the previous years had leaped about 13,000-14,000 points on an annual basis. It is also worth pointing out that Samsung is getting better with its in-house processor development and they are slowly reducing its dependency on Qualcomm chips, at least for its high-end models for now. Even Huawei’s Hi-Silicon processors are getting better since its Kirin 920 that made its debut on the Honor 6. Meanwhile Qualcomm, which was once the dominant choice for top up smart phones is having a rough time battling its   processor issues. Even for the upcoming  , the processor will be clocked at a lower 1.8GHz speeds for better thermal performance and stability.

Apart from the usual suspects, there will be a couple of new “Droids” which will be exclusive to US’s Verizon network. 
 In terms of specs, the Moto G is a refreshed mid-range offering but despite its 3rd generation release, it gets almost the same specs as the previous model.

Based on earlier  , the Moto X might get 4GB of RAM and will be juiced up with a larger 3,280mAh capacity battery. Probably the biggest change for the latest Moto G/X series is the back design where it gets a more rugged looking appearance with a rubbery grip. Apart from being one of the first devices to get the latest Android updates, Motorola will face an uphill battle against other cheap and cheerful offering especially from its rival Chinese brands.

But this doesn’t bode well for iPod lovers as the only member of the family that can access Apple’s new music service is just the Touch, with the possibility of leaving the rest to fade into obscurity. The new iPod Touch has gotten an upgrade from its older A5 processor in favour of a newer 64-bit A8 chip which was also used in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The rear camera has been given an upgrade from 5 megapixel to 8 megapixels and storage starts at 16GB and goes all the way to 128GB should you need such massive storage. The device will be available in blue, pink, red, silver, space grey and a new gold shade. With the vast majority of people using their phones to listen to their music, the relevance of dedicated music players are somewhat questionable now, especially with the prevalence of music streaming services. Granted there are still some brands producing said Mp3 and media players, but these have decreased dramatically as music streaming is now the norm and a larger percentage of people own smartphones. Its hard to say if the refresher will bring the devices back into popularity, but the Touch is still the cheapest entry into becoming an iOS user. The new iPod Touch can be purchased   starting at RM 779 for the 16GB model and RM 1,599 for the high end 128GB model."
Sirap Bandung,Xiaomi announces the Mi Water Purifier,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/16/xiaomi-announces-the-mi-water-purifier/,"mi ecosystem,mi water filter,mi water purifier,water purifier,Xiaomi,xiaomi water filter,xiaomi water purifier",Xiaomi,2015-07-16,"Sometime last year Xiaomi launched their own WiFi enabled  , and now they have just released a brand new water purifier that looks almost identical. Named the Mi Water Purifier, the water filtration device is aimed at getting you clean water fast without taking up too much space in the kitchen. Heath is a pretty big concern for the average Chinese citizen, given that the water is not treated well enough to make it directly drinkable, which is common in most Asian countries. As such, water filters are pretty much a household necessity. The Water Purifier works by transforming tap water into drinkable purified water via reverse osmosis (RO) to remove impurities and pathogens by utilising pressure. It does this by way of four filters that comprise of a cotton filter followed by a activated coconut carbon filter and finally a reverse osmosis membrane before hitting one last carbon filter before it reaches your cup. This is supposed to not just remove all the bad stuff from your water but also make it taste better. The system has a footprint smaller than that of a piece of A4 paper, measuring in at 205 x 260 x410mm so it doesn’t occupy too much space on your sink. Your water is also supposedly filtered a lot faster too, with the system operating at x8 the speed of generic filters making it capable of churning out up to 400 gallons of filtered water a day. It also wastes less water with a 1:1 water production rate to be more efficient. There’s even an app you can use to manage the device, telling you how clean your water is and when its time to clean the filters. On top of simple three step installation, you will get six faucet adapters that are compatible with most tap heads so you can get to using the purifier immediately. The Mi Water Purifier will retail for RMB 1,299 (about RM 796) and like most of Mi’s fancier gadgets, we probably won’t be seeing it sold here officially.

It may be thin, but its still not as skinny as  which rolls in at about 4.9mm thick whereas the display here is 9.9mm thick. In terms of specs, the display is equipped with an MStar 6A928 flagship processor mated to 2GB RAM as well as 8GB internal storage with the entire thing running on the MIUI TV operating system based on Android 5.0 Lollipop. The brand has also developed their own independent sound system to go with the Mi TV 2S Theatre edition, which runs off Dolby sound tech. The system comprises of 2 silk tweeters, 6 full range speakers, a 6.5 inch passive radiator and 6.5 inch subwoofer. They claim that the new system sounds better than a Bose Cinemate 1 SR but we’ll save judgement for real world testing. Also something to mention here is that they’ve given the power plug an overhaul, moving away from the larger more familiar plug to this tiny one that only takes up half the space. Doesn’t look like it would work with Malaysian plug points though, if the picture is any indication. The Mi TV 2S will be retailing for RMB 2,999 (about RM 1839) for the standard version and RMB 3,999 (about RM 2452) for the theatre edition which is a pretty sweet deal for a display that size. We probably won’t be getting the Mi TV 2S here just yet, but we will be sure to let you know if it decides to hit the market here. So what do you think of this super skinny new TV?"

The   is still the most advanced Android smart phone at the moment but for those prefer bigger phones, the new   launch is just right around the corner. Taking its performance up a notch, Samsung will still be using its in-house developed Exynos processor but this time it will combine its Octa-Core 64-bit processor, RAM, GPU, LTE modem and storage into a single chip solution. In terms of RAM, the folks at Sammobile had confirmed that the Galaxy Note 5 will join the big boys by offering 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. So far the   and the upcoming   are the only devices that officially use the same type (LPDDR4) of RAM. The upcoming Galaxy Note 5 has been said to feature a 5.67″ Quad HD display, which is slightly smaller than its current Galaxy Note 4 and of course it will come with its signature S-Pen stylus. Like the Galaxy S6, it will use glass for both front and back, so it is likely that you won’t get a removable battery but it will definitely have wireless charging built-in.   In terms of camera, the front unit is speculated to have the same 5MP sensor as the current Galaxy S6 but it would be further assisted with Optical Image Stabilisation. A purported   has appeared on Samsung’s website on its OIS front camera but strangely it mentions the entire Galaxy S6 range despite the S6 and S6 edge not having hardware based stabilisation for the front cameras.  Usually Samsung would launch the Galaxy Note series during IFA that’s held around September each year but now it is rumoured that they might launch it earlier in August. Apparently Samsung has been pressured to do so due to less than expected sales performance of its current S6 flagships. Furthermore this could also give Samsung extra sales lead time before the new   is announced later this year. For the launch, Samsung has been reported countless of times that they won’t release a new   variant. Instead, they would release a larger version of its Galaxy S6 edge that could be named as the S6 edge Plus. It would look the same as the current Galaxy S6 edge but it gets a larger 5.3-5.4″ display with curve edges for both sides.  Since it isn’t a Note series, it won’t carry an S-Pen stylus and it will be positioned slightly lower than the new Note 5 with a Snapdragon 808 processor on-board. With both the S6 edge Plus and Galaxy Note 5 launched at the same time, we might see a smaller price gap in between and consumers would then need to decide if they prefer to have the S-Pen or a double-edge display. Do you think Samsung’s flagship approach is too fast for its own good? And would you sacrifice the S-Pen for a larger double curved display? Leave your comments below."

On the plus side, the photos won’t become public unless you personally review and approve them. Luckily the solution is pretty simple. All you need to do is head over to your Settings, then to Accounts and finally Google. From there select your main Google account and uncheck the “Sync Photos” option to stop it in its tracks.

Just recently we had a glimpse of its faster   but they are limited to selected test areas within the Klang Valley. You could get 50Mbps for only RM263.94/month (inclusive of GST) which is the same price as their current VIP 20 plan with 20Mbps connectivity. The folks at Lowyat had just   that the new plans are now officially available in all Unifi service areas. So now you can enjoy 30Mbps speeds at RM210.94 a month, which is the same price as their current 10Mbps plan. While it sounds good, there are some differences you should know before making the switch. TM’s current VIP Home Plans – VIP 5, VIP 10 and VIP 20 are having symmetrical bandwidth where you get the same upload speeds as your download speeds. So if you signed up for VIP 10, you get 10Mbps speeds for both download and uploads.  For the new 30Mbps and 50Mbps plans, the speeds are asymmetrical where its upload speeds are much slower than downloads. The new 30Mbps plan gets just 5Mbps for upload while its 50Mbps plan settles for 10Mbps. Is this a big deal? It all depends on your usage. For normal web browsing, video and music streaming, 30Mbps for download is a significant jump from 10Mbps and the lower upload speeds shouldn’t be much of an issue.  However if you upload a lot content especially Full HD or 4K videos, the 5Mbps upload speed would be a bottleneck. It will be the same story as well if plan on uploading huge files or doing video broadcast from your home. Despite a dip in upload speeds, the new Unifi plans are still offering unlimited quota until further notice.  Another big difference is the lack of free landline phone calls. For the current VIP plans, each subscriber can make unlimited phone calls for free to any TM fixed line nationwide. Meanwhile phone calls to mobile numbers are charged at 11sen/minute, which is quite reasonable. On the new 30Mbps/50Mbps plan, there are no free calls included and all calls will be charged at 21sen/minute for both domestic fixed lines and mobile numbers. If someone in your household is making a lot of phone calls especially to land lines, you can top up additional RM21.20/month for its voice pack that gives you 600 minutes of voice calls to any local number. After finishing your 600 minutes, you can still make unlimited phone calls to any fixed line for free, while extra calls to mobile numbers are charged at 11 sen/minute.  By default, all Unifi subscribers get HyppTV with a couple of free channels bundled in. On the newer 30Mbps/50Mbps plans, you get the extra option of either HyppTV Aneka, Varnam or Ruby Packs, which is about 9-12 extra channels depending on your choice. It all depend on your usage. If symmetrical connectivity with higher upload speed and unlimited phone calls are critical, the existing VIP plans would be your preferred option. If 5Mbps upload is sufficient and download speeds are more important, the newer plans offer faster download speeds for less. Essentially the new plans give you more than 2X the download speed but it cuts down your uploads by half for the same monthly subscription. Phone calls to fixed lines are now chargeable on the new plans but you can top up extra RM21.20 each month for the same option as before. To balance the lack of phone calls would be the additional HyppTV channels that you’ll get at no extra charge.  The new plans are available and you can sign up at your nearest TM Point outlet. However do note that existing subscribers will be tied to a fresh 2 year contract when you make the switch. So if you’re on TM’s VIP 10 and VIP 20 plans, would you switch to these newer option?

So far they have released 4 teaser images and it shows something metalic and slender. With a power plug being displayed in the teaser, this is looking like another new appliance. Could it be a new ultra-thin  ? or maybe a whole new product like their  ? Some are speculating it could be a new phone, likely the new Mi 5 flagship smart phone. While it is almost a year since the   was announced, it seems to be too soon for another flagship right after the release of its   and the  .  The Redmi Note phablet is due for a replacement but judging from the teaser image, we don’t think this would be a new smart phone. We have a feeling this could be a new TV that could take on the Sony’s  , which is currently the world’s thinnest. What do you think? Leave your comments below."
Sirap Bandung,Alleged press renders of the Motorola Moto G (2015) emerge,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/13/alleged-press-renders-of-the-motorola-moto-g-2015-emerge/,"Android,Moto G,moto g 2015,motorola moto G 2015,motorola moto G 3rd gen,rumour mill,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Motorola,Rumour Mill",2015-07-13,"Not too long ago we got treated to leaked product photos of the upcoming  , and now it seems we have leaked renders of the phone itself from all angles.

This particular smartphone has already been leaked multiple times, with each leak detailing the phone more and more. The images we see here are in line with what has been shown off so far, down to the rear buttons. The case does appear to have textured and nontextured versions so, these could be backplate variants much like what the previous gen Moto G had as well. In terms of specs the device is expected to have a 64-bit Snapdragon 410 processor mated to 1GB RAM, 8GB storage and LTE support. It’s great that the processor is getting an update but weirdly the phone isn’t getting any extra RAM or storage. The budget smartphone will also be home to a 5 inch 1280 x 720 display as well as a 13 megapixel rear snapper and 5 megapixel front facing camera. Apart from being among the first to run on the very latest flavour of Android, the Moto G specs look underwhelming against today’s cheap and cheerful offering from China. The R  for example is having similar specs but it gets double the amount of RAM and storage for less than RM500.  The phone is expected to be released sometime in September if they are following their Fall release schedule, but plenty of this could still change between then and now."

They maintained that their official outlets, dealers, distributors and partners are carefully selected to provide the highest quality of service and most importantly to sell genuine OPPO products.

If the seller refuses to entertain your requests, the next best step would be to report to the Ministry of Domestic Trade. You can drop them   which they will respond within 3 working days. Do attach the full details including your receipt, device model and the shop that you’ve purchased from."

Here’s an easier way switch from your current device with the Maxis iPhone Trade-Up Program. From now until 31st July, you can trade up from any smart phone and enjoy extra savings when you sign up with Maxis. According to them, they will accept any device even though it’s not functioning anymore, as long as there are no signs of bloated battery, and if it’s an iPhone, it has to be unlocked. All models will be accepted from the old non-touch enabled feature phones to the new mainstream models. If you lost the box and original charger, no worries as Maxis requires just the phone for this programme. Just make sure it is in good condition with a stylus included (if it originally comes with one).  So much does your old phone cost? Let’s find out. We got a bunch of old phones and we visited our local phone shops to get an estimate of its trade-in values. Our collection includes a Galaxy S4 (with a cracked screen), Galaxy S5, Galaxy Note 3, HTC One M7, Nokia N8, Nokia E5, Nokia X3 feature phone and a BlackBerry Torch that’s missing its battery. Then we went to the Maxis Centre at KLCC to find out if they accept them all and how much each of them are worth. When we asked around the phone shops at shopping malls, most of them wouldn’t pay more than RM100 for old feature phones or outdated smart phones. You might get a similar or better deal for newer models as some of them are willing to accept the Note 3 for RM600 and the Galaxy S5 for RM700. Obviously you can probably get a higher price if you can get a direct buyer. For anything else, Maxis trade-up evaluation is on-par if not better than the normal dealers.  Some of you may have a beaten up device that’s still functional like our Galaxy S4. Even if the display is cracked or heavily scratched, Maxis is still accepting it for a minimum value of RM200, or RM300 if you’re a new subscriber (inclusive of new/port-in RM100 promo). Mind you that the extra RM100 for new subscribers will come as a monthly rebate of RM50 for 2 months, which is reflected in your bill.  If the device is non-functional, Maxis is still accepting it but with a minimum value of RM200. Take note however phones with bloated batteries will not be accepted for safety purposes and if you’re trading in an iPhone, it needs to be unlocked beforehand.   
 After handing over your old device, you’ll need to pick your desired iPhone model and a postpaid plan with 24 months contract. For a worry free experience, you can opt for its limitless talk and SMS bundled Maxis OnePlan (2GB internet inclusive) with 1GB of extra internet at RM158/month. For those wishing to commit less, there’s the iValue postpaid plans that start from just RM100/month. During sign up, the trade-in amount will be used to offset the price of the new device. So if we trade-up the Galaxy S5 with Maxis as a new subscriber, we can get RM900 off (RM800 + RM100) from its bundled pricing. This means we could get the iPhone 6 16GB effectively for Free on iValue 3, or RM639 (before GST) on their MaxisOne Plan. Meanwhile if you’re using an iPhone 5 (valued at RM600), you could potentially pick up the iPhone 6 from as low as RM109 (before GST) on iValue 3 contract with Maxis as a new subscriber.   With its RM200 minimum trade-up guarantee and an extra RM100 off for new subscribers, it’s also a good opportunity to dispose that old dusty feature phone of yours. For existing Maxis subscribers with good payment records, they will waive the advance payment that’s usually required upfront when you sign on a contract.  The   program aims to be your one stop centre to make the iPhone 6 switch without the hassle of disposing your current phone the old fashion way. The whole process is seamless and you can walk in with your old phone and out with a brand new iPhone 6 in one single visit. With the extra savings, it is more worthwhile than to buy the iPhone 6 outright which costs at least RM2,702 with GST. To get started, just visit any Maxis Centre or Maxis Exclusive Partner nationwide with your current phone."

If you are keen on trying it out for yourself you can get into the program , just be aware that it is still in development so you will obviously come across some bugs.

The   has a metal unibody design and powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor mated to 3GB RAM under the hood. There’s 32GB of on-board storage which can be expanded with microSD up to 128GB. This is a dual-SIM 4G LTE device, and the microSD slot also doubles up as a 2nd sim slot. The unit will be powered by an enormous 4,100mAh battery which supports VOOC Flash Charging. The R7 Plus will also be running ColorOS 2.1 based on Android 5.1 out of the box.

Coming in at $399 (about RM 1521) this tiny cube-shaped shooter measures just 1.5 inches long, is waterproof up to 10 meters and is capable of shooting 1440p video at 30fps. GoPro has done a lot in slimming down their cameras with the Session being the most unobtrusive model they have. It lacks some of the hardware that its bigger brother the  has, but apparently doesn’t slack in terms of capability. In a sense, the device is in the same vein as the  and the  which also run on the same single button style of operation. The two are also a lot more affordable than the Session, with them being priced at RM 669 (from  )and RM 429 respectively. While the Session does come with a strap, the HTC RE is probably easier to hold on to as it has a more ergonomic shape, albeit one shaped like a plastic tube. However, if you want to change any of the settings on the camera you have to use included Wi-Fi remote (which is sold seperately) or go through the GoPro’s mobile app. It does have an absolutely tiny screen at the top of it but this is mainly to show you your battery level and active settings. You will still have to rely on an external device to view your videos and images. The Session also has two mics, one at the front and one at the rear that switch dynamically to reduce wind noise. For storage, the Session can handle any microSD card with a class 10 or UHS-1 rating up to a capacity of 64GB. How much you will be able to cram into it though, depends a lot on your recording resolution. There are some drawbacks to its compact size, one being it is incapable of recording in 4K, takes stills in 8 megapixels only and cannot record video above 100fps. But these seem to be relatively small trade-offs for what you’re already getting in this compact form factor. Regardless, like all GoPro devices the Session will have access to a small mountain of mounting options and accessories to choose from, which makes it even more versatile. The GoPro Hero 4 Session is set to hit the market sometime next week, though we don’t know if it will be getting a Malaysian launch just yet. In the mean time, you can check out its product page  ."

Announced  , OPPO Malaysia is bringing 2 models, the   phablet and a more compact R7 Lite. For the Malaysian market, we won’t be getting the original R7 but instead we are getting the   that offers lower specs and it carries a much lower price tag.  As other manufacturers have been pushing specs for their new flagship models, OPPO on the other hand decides to focus on premium design with slimness as their main highlight. Powering the devices is a mid-range Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor that’s also found on the  ,   and  . The R7 series offers a unibody metal frame which is apparently inspired by the design of a violin. It is thin to hold but the R7 isn’t as thin as their once world record holder, the R5 which boast a ridiculously thin 4.85mm side profile.  The R7 Plus is a huge device with a 6″ Full HD AMOLED display but it manages to boast a high screen to body ratio with the use of on-screen buttons for the front. Overall it feels quite a well polished device with the use of 2.5D glass which makes the edge smoother to touch and it manages to keep its bulk in check with a 7.75mm thickness. With a 4,100mAh capacity battery, it feels heavier at 203 grams, but at least it’s lighter than the former 5.9″ OPPO N1 (213 grams). From a design perspective, it does   of the   which coincidentally also comes with a 6″ display, a rear mounted fingerprint scanner and a 4,100mAh capacity battery. In terms of specs, the Mate 7 may have a better processor but it loses out in the camera and fast charging department.  Under the hood, the R7 Plus gets a Snapdragon 615 processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM with 32GB of on-board storage. You can expand up to 128GB extra via microSD card which would utilise its secondary SIM tray slot. Connectivity wise, the R7 Plus supports 4G LTE on both SIM slots as well as WiFi 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.0.  In the camera department, the main shooter uses Sony’s 13MP IMX278 camera sensor that’s similarly found on the Huawei P8. It boasts a quicker 0.1 second focus time with its Phase Detection AF and the sensor is a 4-colour RGBW unit. It is assisted with a dual-tone LED flash and there’s a laser auto focus light for guidance. Over at the front, there’s an 8MP camera with Beautify 3.0 selfie feature.   Out of the box, the R7 Plus is running on their latest iteration of ColorOS 2.1 which is based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. Finally OPPO has a smart phone that runs on a newer operating system as the past few models have been stuck with KitKat or an older version. According to OPPO, the new ColorOS has been improved for faster boot times, stability and smoothness. In our short playtime, it does feel quick and that’s to be expected with a fresh new device with 3GB RAM. Like its previous flagship offering, you can double tap to wake or launch apps from sleep by drawing gestures on the screen.  Also supported is VOOC Flash Charging which boast faster charging in a shorter time. During its media launch, we are told that the R7 Plus is still capable of doing 75% charge in just 30 minutes, and a 5 minutes charge is enough to sustain 2 hours of talk time which is quite remarkable. Priced at RM1,998, the R7 Plus is quite a high price to pay for a Snapdragon 615 powered device but it tries to make up for it by having a larger screen, bigger battery capacity and having a more premium build quality. The R7 Plus will be open for pre-orders on 11th July with official availability targeted for early August. : We’ve been informed that the “OPPO R7 Lite” shown here is actually the original R7 that comes with a Full HD display and has 3GB of RAM. However the exterior design and dimensions are identical with the OPPO R7 Lite.  The next device is the R7 Lite which is priced at RM1,298. When we asked why is OPPO offering the R7 Lite instead of the full fledged R7 in Malaysia, we are told that this is to cater for a price sensitive segment since the R7 Lite is priced at RM700 lower than its top of the line R7 Plus. On the exterior, this is essentially the same R7 with a 5″ display but it is downgraded in terms of RAM with just 2GB (instead of 3GB) while the screen resolution pushes a standard HD 720p resolution instead of Full HD.  The build quality is similar with its R7 Plus with a metal unibody design as well as a smoothen-out 2.5D glass for the front. The R7 Lite feels more refined with more curves and polished frame, as opposed to its similar spec-ed R1x that has more sharp edges. On the front it gets 3 capacitive buttons which are not illuminated, while the back gets a clean metal back with its camera and LED flash being positioned at the top left corner. In terms of thickness, the R7 Lite is 6.3mm thin, which is the same as the Galaxy A7, Samsung’s thinnest smart phone at the moment.  The speaker like its bigger R7 Plus sibling is positioned at the back of the device, which we felt could better place on the bottom of the device. For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP main camera while the front get a high resolution 8MP shooter. Being a “Lite” device, another omission is the lack of VOOC Flash Charge but it still claims to have a Fast Charger without mentioning its actual charge rate.  Under the hood, it gets 2GB RAM, 16GB of storage and it also supports dual-SIM with 4G LTE. If you need to expand more storage, the 2nd slim slot also doubles up as a microSD expansion. During the launch, the R7 Lite is still running on KitKat but we’re told that it will be running on the latest ColorOS 2.1 with Android 5.1 by the time it goes on sale. It’s a nice device but it is quite hard to recommend this over higher spec smart phones within the same price range like the highest spec ASUS ZenFone 2, OnePlus One or Honor 6."

On the exterior, it is identical but it is slightly thicker at 9.75mm and lighter at 155 grams. This is due to its polycarbonate back but it still uses a metal frame around the sides for a subtle touch of premium.  Over at the front, you still get its stereo BoomSound speakers, a fingerprint sensor and a 4MP Ultrapixel front camera. Meanwhile at the back, it gets a 20MP main camera with dual-LED flash like its One M9, which is a single unit without the extra Duo Camera set up.

Mexican users on the other hand will not have interruptions to their services but will be given the same options. On the other hand, Apple is making two new low-price tiers available for India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and Turkey called Alternate Tier A and Alternate Tier B, which has already been active in the Chinese market. But it seems a bit weird that Mexico, South Africa and Turkey are getting a price increase but are also subject to the two new low-price tiers, so what exactly is Apple going to be doing for these three countries? As for us, we don’t know yet if we will be affected by the fluctuations (our currency is taking a divebomb after all) so will we see higher or lower prices for the Malaysia market? What do you think?"

Initially, images uploaded to Instagram were only being displayed at 640 x 640 resolution, which is markedly small by today’s standards. But starting last week it seems that images being uploaded are being saved in 1080p resolution, probably in the process of getting the platform ready for the switch. Instagram themselves originally denied that they are saving images at any higher than 640 x 640, but the program is undoubtedly saving and displaying images at a much higher resolution than before. They’ve now confirmed that they will gradually be rolling out the feature for iOS and Android, but the web version won’t be getting any love just yet. For now the only way to spot it at the moment is by delving into the image’s source code on Instagram web, where the first link with the .jpg suffix will tell you the image’s size via a browser like Chrome or Firefox. Checking the image out on mobile (as in, your phone’s Instagram folder) still displays the original resolution which it was snapped in, which in turn is reliant on your phone’s camera. We don’t quite know why they are limiting the new image size for the desktop version but this is already great news for Instagrammers as they won’t have their images as compressed as they used to be.

With an IP certification of IP X7, the watch can basically handle being submerged for up to 30 minutes in up to a metre deep of water with no issue but even then Apple doesn’t recommend wearing it to the pool. Developer Ted Bradley is the guy behind the app, having written a similar one for the Pebble and porting it over to the Apple Watch. Granted he had issues porting it over due to differences between the interfaces and the complexity of the OS. Like on the Pebble apps stay open till the user closes it while on the Watch the screen shuts off to save on power, causing the app to stop measuring real time data. However there are APIs in place that allow the Watch to recall data stored while the screen is off, so once the screen is back on you get the rest of the information, albeit with a bit of lag. The info can also be imported to HealthKit to measure the number of laps completed and distance covered, making use of the heart rate sensor as well. As well as the app works, Apple does not endorse apps that encourage users to use an Apple device in ways that could possibly damage it, hence why you will never find it on the App Store. Bradley and his team does hope that the next gen Apple Watch has better waterproofing so apps like his can really get the most out of the Watch."

You’re not alone. The update generally made it a struggle for iOS 8.4 users to use turn-by-turn navigation and other functions of navigation software like Apple Maps, Google Maps and Waze. But do not fret, we have some solutions to help you tackle the problem. There are three ways you can attempt to fix the GPS issue, either by resetting your network settings, turning location services on or off and even backup and restore fresh using iTunes. To reset your network settings, head on over to the Settings app and then head over to General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This will reset all your network settings and wipe your WiFi password but it will help fix the problem. Another alternative is turning the location services of and off. It’s slightly trickier than the above solution but its well worth it. First head on over to your Location Services in your settings in this order Settings > Privacy  > Location Services, and turn the switch off. Next restart your iPhone and turn the switch back on and the problem should be rectified. The last one is the hardest to do and should be used as a last resort should all else fail. Make sure you have backed up everything using iTunes or iCloud before you do this, and restore fresh to iOS 8.4 using iTunes. It’s a long process but there is a chance it might fix the GPS issue. You can grab the   here. The last alternative however, if you couldn’t fix it using any of the methods above is to wait for Apple to release a fix themselves, though it does mean you won’t be able to get around too much if you’re the sort that gets lost a lot.

In South Korea with 1,000 units to go around, the Iron Man themed device is priced at 1.19 million Won which is slightly more than RM4,000. If you’re dying to buy one, DirectD can make it happen for RM10,999, with GST included of course. You get the Galaxy S6 edge in a nice exclusive box and it comes with a wireless charger with Iron Man’s core reactor design on top. As for the device, the Galaxy S6 edge gets a stunning red colour body surrounded by a gold colour frame. Everything else in the phone is the same, and it also comes with 64GB of non-expandable storage on-board. For some, RM10,999 could be a bargain considering a unit was   for about RM340,000 in China and that’s because of a double digit serial number 66. After all, this is a country with a growing wealthy population which a guy can afford to buy not one, but  . If you’re interested and money is no object to you, head over to   to pre-order yours. Sorry, JARVIS isn’t included."

In comparison with other wearables, Fitbit is solely focused on fitness and they currently have   in Malaysia. Its Charge HR (RM510) and Surge (RM968) wearables offer continuous heart rate monitoring and they last 7 days on a single charge. This is quite remarkable considering other smart watches only offer heart rate reading on demand or at specific time intervals.

Every little thing out of place could be home to that very chip that they’re tracking all your calls with, waiting for the right bit of juicy information to use as an excuse to whisk you off, never to be seen again. Smartphones are pretty complicated as they are, and if you open yours you are likely to find a lot of things you don’t understand within. In particular, Samsung batteries have attracted attention recently for “hiding” spy chips within, leading people to actually peel them open to remove the little coil inside.    The truth is that’s just an NFC (Near Field Communication) antenna. People outside the tech bubble probably don’t even know what NFC is, and videos circulating about people removing the receiver has sparked a fair bit of paranoia. As the claim goes, the chip is supposedly communicating wirelessly with other sources and is leaking your data and photos without your knowledge. While the wireless communication bit is true (that’s what NFC is designed to do) but trust us, the government probably doesn’t want to see what you’ve been doing on Facebook all day. Plus you’ll need another device to physically touch the NFC panel in order for information to be exchanged.    The myth was likely originally perpetuated by  ; who has been repeatedly   by many people, including a   that Samsung was spying on him with the said mysterious chip.

The Honor 6 is one of our favourite 5″ flagship devices which is now going for RM899. The Honor brand is supposedly Huawei’s answer to the growing demand of high spec smart phones with a more affordable price tag.  With the new Honor 7, it looks like the aggressive sub-brand is taking a more premium step. Like its predecessor, the Honor 7 appears to be better than the current   flagship and it even shares some similarities with its larger   phablet. For starters, the Honor 7 gets an aluminium alloy shell for both front and back which not only gives it better durability but it also helps to improve thermal efficiency. The front gets a slightly larger 5.2″ Full HD display, which is similar to its current Huawei P8. Powering the device is their top of the line Kirin 935 64-bit Octa-Core processor which utilises 4x A53 Cores @ 2.2GHz + 4x A53 Cores @ 1.5GHz. This is mated to 3GB of LPDDR3 RAM and depending on variant, you get either 16GB or 64GB of on-board storage. The Honor 7 is also a dual-SIM 4G LTE device and the secondary SIM slot also accepts microSD expansion up to 128GB.  Camera is quite a big deal for the Honor 7. The back gets a 20MP f/2.0   Exmor RS sensor which comes with fast Phase Detection Auto Focus. Meanwhile the front gets a 8MP f/2.4 selfie camera with 1.4micron pixel size, a 26mm wide angle lens and a soft flash for better illumination. Like most Chinese smart phones, it gets their latest version of their auto beautification feature. Powering the Honor 7 is a similar capacity 3,100mAh battery as the predecessor but now it supports quick charge that does 50% in just 30 minutes. Also included at the back is a new generation one touch fingerprint scanner which claims to unlock in just 0.5 seconds.   Another major highlight is the Honor 7’s voice controls which you can get it to launch apps or play music without waking your device physically, similar to the  . On the left side, there’s a dedicated button which calls up “ZhiLing”, supposedly Honor’s answer to the likes of Siri and Google Now. For now, it looks like this is applicable for the Chinese market and we’re not too sure if this will be rolled out for our region. Overall, the Honor 7 is 8.5mm thick and weighs 157 grams, which is heavier and thicker than the current Honor 6 at 7.5mm and 130 grams. According to  , the Honor 7 with 16GB storage starts from 1,999 CNY (about RM1,217) and it goes all the way up to 2,499 CNY (about RM1,521) for the 64GB version. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop with EMUI 3.1.  For more info, visit Honor 7’s  ."

The camera also appears to be protruding at the back which is quite common among Samsung’s more current devices. If they are following the same design philosophy as they have with the S6 and S6 edge the Note 5 would likely have a glass back as well.

They added that the processor carrying the model number MSM8996 had scored 1732 in single-core and 4970 in muli-core tests. That’s quite a leap from its current Snapdragon 810 processor which scores 1227 in single-core and 4424 in multi-core Geekbench tests.

It gets 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage which is expandable up to 32GB extra using microSD. It also gets a 8MP main + 2MP front cameras, as well as your typical WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS and 3G connectivity with dual-SIM standby. It runs on Android 4.4 KitKat and powering the device is a 2,100mAh capacity battery. The JOI 7 Lite shares similar underpinnings as the JOI Phone 5 but it gets a larger 7″ IPS display which pushes a 1024×600 resolution. It also gets the same Intel Atom x3 powerhouse with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage with microSD support. However its camera settles for a rather basic 2MP shooter for the back and a front facing VGA camera.  The JOI 7 Lite tablet also supports phone calls and SMS, and it also comes with dual-SIM slots with 3G like its JOI Phone 5. Keeping the lights on is a 2,600mAh capacity battery. In terms of build, both devices feel quite plasticky but you really can’t complain for what it packs with such a low price tag."

The Deus Ex Aria is a Kickstarter project that actually makes this possible by transforming your smartwatch into something a little more hands free, pun intended. The Aria comes in two forms, a clip for Android Wear watches and a special strap for the Pebble Time, but is compatible with all Android Wear watches, including the ones you see below. In its clip form, its very small and unobtrusive as to not add too much extra bulk to your smartwatch. Basically, the Aria uses sensors to recognise gestures, specifically that of your fingers to navigate and otherwise control your device. Primarily the Aria lets you access your smartwatch without having to touch it, but it can also be used to control your smartphone as well. Answer your calls, swap through your music collection and even check or read your email. The device can even be hooked up to your GoPro via your smartphone to remotely send commands to the camera. This opens up a whole new world in how you can interact with your smartphone and wiggly fingers is just the tip of the iceberg.  The gestures are customiseable too, so you can tweak it to your personal preferences. The company is also releasing an SDK for any developers who are interested in producing apps for the device. They are hoping that the Aria can be used for other more complex actions like interacting with notebooks and perhaps even flying drones in the future.

That said, could it be possible that LG is gearing up for a local launch? To recap on the specs, the LG G4 gets a similar sized 5.5″ Quad HD display (2560×1440) as the previous model but it is enhanced with better brightness and contrast ratio with its Advanced In-Cell Touch technology. Under the hood, instead of a top of the line Snapdragon 810, it runs on a Hexa Core Snapdragon 808 processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board there’s 32GB of on-board storage and you can also expand the storage with a microSD card. For taking pictures, the LG G4 claims to give the most manual controls with its 16MP f/1.8 rear caemra with Optical Image Stabilisation. For taking selfies, it features a higher resolution 8MP f/2.0 front camera. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery that supports fast charging, wireless charging (optional Quick Circle Case required) and it is removable too.

soyacincau,The Apple Watch: It isn’t the game changer we’re looking for,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/06/23/the-apple-watch-it-isnt-the-game-changer-were-looking-for/,,,2015-06-23,"Like it or not, Apple is often seen as the benchmark in every product line. The iPhone revolutionised how touch screen smart phones work while the iPad turned out to be the   consumer product in history.   The truth is Apple never created anything new. They were not the first to create a smart phone, a tablet or even a music player. But somehow they managed to take an existing product and turned it into something new, prompting you to ask yourself “why didn’t anyone think of that?”  As wearables are seen as the next hot category, Apple has finally jumped onto the bandwagon with the Apple Watch. Its competitors especially from the Pebble and Android Wear camp had an early start and this should give Apple some insights on what to do, and what not to do. Can Apple emulate the same success with the Smart Watch? Or is it all just for looks? Find out in our review. First up, let’s go through the entire range of the Apple Watch. Unlike any smart watch or Apple products released so far, the watch has the most customisation you can buy right from the store.  There are 3 main models, the entry-level Apple Watch Sport, the mid-tier Apple Watch and the cream of the crop Apple Watch Edition. To fit different wrist sizes, it is available in 38mm and 42mm editions, where the dimensions represent the height of the watch.  The Apple Watch Sport gets an aluminium case in either silver or space grey. It feels similar to the iPhone 6 and the front is toughen with strengthen Ion-X class. Being a base model, it comes only with a choice of multi-colour rubber bands. The strap mechanism is the same as the rest of its models which allows you buy the more premium bands separately.  Moving up a notch is the Apple Watch which gets a stainless steel case with a shiny chrome finish or space black. For those who consider money as no object, the Apple Watch edition can be yours in either 18 carat yellow or rose gold bodies. The front glass for the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition is more durable with the use of Sapphire Glass, while the back uses ceramic for better scuff resistance compared to the standard Sport version.  Unlike the Sport, the higher Apple Watch and Watch Editions get a wider choice of bands which includes leather and metal. As you go up a notch, you can feel the weight difference on your wrist. For example the 42mm Apple Watch Sport with the rubber sport band weighs just 30 grams and it gets heavier at 50 grams with the stainless steel body Apple Watch. Meanwhile the rose gold Apple Watch Edition weighs 67 grams while the yellow gold option is heavier at 69 grams, and this is with the base rubber sport band. That’s more than double the weight of its entry-level aluminium version.   Regardless of which Watch you pick, you get the same internals inside except for its screen and battery. The 38mm and 42mm versions have a slightly different screen size with a resolution of 272×340 and 312×390 pixels respectively. Despite the variation on paper, both OLED displays shouldn’t differ much in clarity as they push the same pixel density of 326ppi (pixels per inch)."

For the Xperia Z3+ Dual-SIM version, it is offered slightly higher at RM2,699. Since this isn’t an official Sony Malaysia set, DirectD is giving its own 2 year warranty. To recap, the Xperia Z3+ is the   of the Japan exclusive  . While the appearance looks the same as the current Xperia Z3, the Xperia Z3+ is actually thinner at 6.9mm (Z3: 7.3mm) and lighter at 144g (Z3: 152g). Another welcomed change is a cap-less microUSB port design, which makes it easier to charge without the need of removing flap covers. Like its previous models, it still maintains the highest waterproofing for a smart phone at IP68 rating. This allows it to be submerged under 1.5m of fresh water up to 30 minutes. The front still gets a 5.2″ Full HD (1920×1080) display and under the hood, it gets Qualcomm’s top of the line 2.0GHz octa-core Snapdragon 810 64-bit processor with 3GB of RAM. For storage there’s 32GB on-board which can be expanded using microSD card. As comparison, the current Z3 runs on a 2.5GHz Snapdragon 801 processor and it gets just 16GB of storage.   For imaging, its main camera remains unchanged with a 20.7MP Exmor RS sensor with a 25mm f/2.0 lens. However the front camera has been upgraded with a 5MP shooter. In the battery department, the battery has shrunk from 3,100mAh on the Z3 to just 2,930mAh with the latest model, but Sony still claims to be able to provide up to 2 days of battery life per charge. With its quick charge feature, they reckon you can get a full day of use with just 45 minutes of charging. For more info, you can check out DirectD’s Sony Xperia Z3+  ."

Of the new features the device reportedly will have is a FaceTime camera for video calls. The decision to include the camera isn’t yet set in stone so it might not even make it to the final product. Also the next Apple Watch is rumoured to be adopting Wi-Fi compatibility to make the watch less dependent on your phone and capable of more on its own. The Wi-Fi chip will also allow the Find my Watch feature to work better and allow the company to track the watches via router triangulation instead of GPS. However this would impact the battery life so Apple is attempting to get more usage time out of the battery; which as it is only lasts about 18 hours at best with varied usage. Ultimately Apple is planning for more models of the Watch, but we don’t know yet what are they planning in terms of design, materials or other potential factors in the make of the next gen Watch.

The screen on the other hand will be a 5 inch display with a 720p resolution. The camera has gotten quite a major upgrade, with a 13 megapixel rear snapper with dual-LED flash and a 5 megapixel front facing selfie shooter. As far as we can tell the Moto G (2015) pretty much is the same as the previous gen save for a better camera and a different processor but generally sports the same innards and screen. The device apparently is also booting Android 5.1.1 Lollipop so we hope the phone has a handle on the OS’s apparently battery draining habits.

For those not in the know, the Raspberry Pi is basically a tiny PC that’s a fraction of the size of a traditional desktop that’s extremely popular amongst the tinkering crowd. Generally the Raspberry Pi gets inserted into other projects (and as such would require customised cases built for it) but at least now the option for a case is available. The case is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B or the Model B+ for the original Pi. It may not look like much but it goes a long way in keeping the Pi’s usually bare circuitry protected and it makes access to the ports a lot cleaner. The add on case costs just $9 (about RM 33) so if you happen to be using it as a self contained machine, it’s well worth the price."

There’s a high chance you have authenticated your identity with your email service using your smartphone. It’s an extremely common and easy way to get access back to your account but this also presents a potential vulnerability if someone has your phone number and email address. A bit of creative texting and catching you off guard is all someone needs to compromise your email account. This phishing attempt is then started by initiating a verification code process with your email provider and having them send a text message to your phone with the code. Then they will immediately follow-up with a message about unauthorized activity and for a response with the authentic authorization code. While it does appear suspicious, if you happen to be in the middle of something you probably won’t think twice about responding with the code. After that the perpetrator is more than able to get access to your mail and lock you out. This is twice as bad if you happen to have important information stored on your account (which you likely do) and could lead to more than just being inconveniently denied access. Below is a video by Symantec detailing how exactly this happens and how to avoid getting tricked into losing control of your email account.

The USB Type C which looks like Apple’s lightning connector is seen as the new standard for charging and data transfer. It was developed alongside USB 3.1 so you can expect higher data transfer speeds without the bulky micro USB 3.0 connector head that came with the Galaxy Note 3.

In Argentina, almost a person dies every hour in a traffic accident, which is not much different from Malaysia with   each day.  As an initiative, Samsung Argentina had come out with an interesting idea which makes overtaking safer. Dubbed as the Samsung Safety Truck, they have fitted 4 large screen monitors at the back of their trucks which displays a live feed taken from the front camera. This allow vehicles behind it to get a clearer view of what’s ahead, which is useful at single-lane roads. It works in the dark as well since the front camera has night vision.

How it works is that the app will allow you to share your photos with friends who are in the shot and get photos you are in as well. It accomplishes this by syncing photos and connecting people with facial recognition technology to find out who was there with you without having to plaster it all over your feeds or take multiple shots of the same thing. The app will then group together photos on your phone based on when they were taken and you can then privately sync those photos with specific friends and vice versa.

This allows for longer private messages, making it a more viable as an instant messaging channel.

This makes it easier to report problems to brand customer support on Twitter especially to airlines and telcos.

For starters, the device will be launching with a 6 inch QHD display at 2560 x 1400 and the Exynos 7420 processor under the hood .

Looking like an oversized eight-ball when inactive, the BSP60 is colourful, chripy and most importantly would love to dance with you. The device is basically a cuter and smaller version of the “Rolly” which is shaped like an American football and gets around by way of two outer rollers that function as its wheels. While it still has wheels to get around, the BSP60 instead has three small wheels in its base and the main moving components being two “ears” at the top of it. The BSP60 is quite similar in function (minus the ability to “flap” as you would see in the video above) but likes to dance just as much as it would like to wake you up in the morning with your favourite tunes. Like many of Sony’s newer audio devices it will have NFC One-touchsupport. The device is also capable of intelligent hands-free calling, voice control, notifications as well as the weather report if you would like it. It even supports multiple languages and can be communicated with in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese and Spanish.

While on the surface it doesn’t look radically different since iOS 7, the new version brings a couple of major refinements for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch which are big on productivity and intelligence. In a nutshell, iOS 9 is supposed to work harder for you, to give you what you want based on your past and current behaviour. For those using the iPad for work, iOS 9 offers better multi-tasking features which has been present on other tablets in the market. It is safe to say that Apple has gotten some inspiration from its rivals.  Head after the break for our list of 9 things to look forward to in the upcoming iOS upgrade that’s due end of this year.  
On the far left of the home screen lives the new Spotlight Search, which is where the original Search panel was placed before it was changed in iOS 7. Based on your frequent usage, it will understand your habits and will suggest contacts and apps accordingly. So if you often load a certain app or contact a person at a specific time and place, Spotlight will pick this up and will recommend them in future. This is somewhat similar to Nokia’s  .    They have introduced new Proactive Assistant, which is something that rivals Google Now. The popular voice assistant now takes into consideration the context of your request, such as time and location. So it can do things like reminding you of your next appointment along with the traffic info for your destination. If a call comes in from an unknown number, its proactive capabilities will try to match the caller from your past emails which includes the contact info so that you’ll know whose calling. Its search capabilities goes deeper now into the app level and you could even ask Siri to find specific photos, such as time or place where it was taken from your camera roll. On iOS 9, Siri is claimed to be up to 40% faster and is 40% more accurate than before.  
Notes is a great way for taking things down and it gets a whole lot better on iOS 9. It gets revamped with extra features like creating a checkable list and you can even sketch using your fingers and add items from Safari, Maps and other supported apps. This looks like Apple’s answer to Samsung’s S Note app that comes as standard with the Galaxy Note series. With iCloud, you can sync your notes across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.  
Apple Maps now includes public transport directions which covers buses, trains, subways and ferries but it will first roll out at selected cities. While exploring new locations, Maps will also show you what’s interesting nearby, from food, cafes, shopping to popular activities.  For better multi-tasking, iPad users now get Multi-Window. You can choose to slide over an app from the sides, which is very useful if you constantly respond to messages or social feed. For a more permanent set up, you can display 2 apps simultaneously in either 50-50 or 30-70 split.  The iPad also gets Floating Picture in picture video playback, where you can continue to watch your video in a pop-up window while you’re running other apps. This isn’t entirely new and Samsung has introduced this a couple of Galaxy models back. 
The keyboard now also doubles up as trackpad which is toggled by dragging two fingers. This makes it effortless to move the cursor around or to select text. There’s also direct copy, cut and paste shortcuts on the keyboard, making word processing a whole lot easier. The new keyboard and multi-window feature currently works only with the iPad Air 2, which is their most powerful iOS device right now. This is probably good news to those who bought an iOS device with the least storage capacity. For those who tried upgrade to iOS 8, most users would need about 5GB of free space to upgrade, which is a challenge with those using a 16GB device. For the new iOS 9, they had made updating more efficient by streaming the updates directly as opposed to downloading the entire package, that would require more space to unpack. As a result, iOS 9 would require just 1.3GB of available space to upgrade. 
A new feature which can be a life saver, iOS 9 now incorporates Low Power Mode. This helps to extend the final few bars of battery life by throttling its performance, reducing background sync and disabling unnecessary animations. They have done some extra tweaks including disable on-screen notification if the phone is facing downwards. With all the fine tweaks, Apple reckons that you can get an extra 3 hours of battery life and 1 hour of usage after upgrading to iOS 9. 
For those paranoid about security, you’ll be happy to know that Apple has beefed up its authentication process to deter unwanted access. The passcode is now longer with 6 digits and you can also enable two way authentication where you’re are required to key an extra password that was sent to another Apple product or phone.  
iOS 9 will be rolled out officially this fall, which starts somewhere in September. In terms of compatibility, it will be available for iPhones from iPhone 4S and above, and iPads starting from the iPad 2 and first gen iPad mini. In addition, it is also coming to the 5th generation iPod Touch. To sum up the top features on iOS 9, you can watch the video below:"

There isn’t much known yet about the new mystery phone but it will be something totally different from what HTC has planned for its 2016 flagship device. Its safe to say that it will be a smartphone and given that HTC will be a Windows 10 partner it is likely to be a Windows phone. Rumours are currently pointing at a possible  variant with Windows 10 slapped on but it doesn’t sound much like a flagship. But what could it be? maybe a new Butterfly 3 for international markets or a high performing but affordable priced Desire to rack in the numbers perhaps? HTC is also planning on realigning their goals and priorities with an increase in research and development investments by 4% for a  total of US$419.33 million while the marketing budget has been slashed down by 19.26%. The brand will also be focusing on some new market niches too, like the Vive virtual reality headset that it is developing with Valve. Hard to say where HTC’s new direction will take it for now but if it works out we could be seeing quite some change."

For those who need more power, here comes a new high-spec BlackBerry which looks like another variant (possibly cheaper) of the Passport.   With the code name BlackBerry Oslo/Dallas, the upcoming device gets a similar Passport form factor which has a wider width. Instead of a serious business look, it gets a silver colour body that uses both metal and plastic. Just like the Passport, it gets a QWERTY keyboard with 3 rows that also doubles up as a trackpad. Spec wise, it gets a similar 2.2GHz MSM8974 processor from the Snapdragon 801 range, that’s mated to 3GB RAM and is powered by a 3,450mAh capacity battery.

With the rise of new music services such as Spotify, Apple is now introducing Apple Music, which offers an “all you can listen” ad-free music experience including offline for a fixed monthly subscription.  Interestingly Steve Jobs didn’t believe in the subscription model and this is a big shift from its current approach of selling songs ala carte by track or album. Back in 2003, the Apple co-founder once said that subscription music services were going to fail and people won’t buy music as a subscription. “When they want music, they bought 45s, LPs, cassettes, 8-tracks, CDs and then they are going to buy downloads”, he said in an  .

On top of that Apple has revamped its streaming radio offering with the big names of music curating these stations. One of such stations is BeatsOne, a 24 hour streaming station that’s handled by DJs like Zane Lowe, Ebro Darden and Julia Adenuga.  To complete the music service, there’s also Connect, a social platform that connects artists to their loyal fans. In short, it is like a micro blog where fans can subscribe to, to get the latest updates, and even get first hand access to the latest albums.   Apple Music will be available starting 30th June across 100 countries and it will be rolled out with its upcoming iOS 8.4 update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Not leaving anyone else behind, it will also be available for Windows and Android users this Fall, which is in Q3 this year. As Apple Music comes pre-installed in every new device running iOS 8.4 and above, Apple hopes that more users would jump on board its subscription service especially with its free 3 month subscription offer.

To showcase how much power savings the new features bring in a real life setting, a  was loaded with a copy of the Android M Developer Preview and measured against the same model with Android 5.1.1 in it. Of the new features that will be coming with Android M is   and App Standby which helps save on power in two different ways. Doze for instance is activated when your device is inactive for a certain period of time and causes your phone to go into a “deeper sleep” and halt processes that would normally continue running when on standby. Once you pick up your phone Doze gets disabled and it resumes as usual, doubling standby time. App Standby on the other hand prohibits inactive apps from getting network support and open jobs are suspended once your device is unplugged from the charger. When your phone is plugged in again, the apps will reconnect. This would work best if Android M gave users the ability to enable or disable the feature for particular apps. So how did the devices do? The result? after 8 hours in standby the Nexus 5 with Android 5.1.1 consumed just 4% of battery as opposed to the Nexus 5 with Android M which only consumed 1.5% battery. After 24 hours the Nexus with Lollipop had eaten through 12% of its battery while the Android M device had only consumed 4.5% of power during the same duration. After an additional 24 hours the Android 5.1.1 device had chewed its way through 24% battery while the Android M Nexus 5 had taken just 9%. In total the Lollipop device was projected to last for about 200 hours on standby while the latter was projected to last more than double of that at 533 hours on standby. LG and Huawei have also been rumoured to be in the process of producing the   smartphones that possibly might come with Android M pre-loaded. Suffice to say Android M is already looking good from the power consumption department and we can’t wait to get a hold of the full release when its officially released in Q3."

There’s a catch however, as great as your smartphone is for entertainment on-the-go, it still can’t beat watching all those videos on a big flat screen TV.  That’s about to change though as now there’s a way for you to put all that entertainment that you have on your smartphone, onto that sweet large flatscreen TV you have at home. How? It’s all thanks to the  , offered exclusively by Maxis.  So what is the Chromecast? It’s a small dongle that attaches itself to a TV via the HDMI port. What it can do is allow you to cast your favourite entertainment from your devices straight to your TV. It’s really simple to setup as well. Just plug it into your TV, make sure it’s powered via power outlet or the TV’s USB port, set it up through the Chromecast app on your smartphone and you’re ready to cast. Now this simple gadget may not look like much but hidden in this little gem is a way to use your smartphone in a whole new way. So how will it do that? Here’s just a few examples As long as your TV has a HDMI port, it’ll work with the Chromecast. And that’s basically almost all modern flat-screen TVs out in the market these days. Now your smartphone can be home to a multitude of media, all of which would sometimes be wasted on a small screen. With the Chromecast, you can now push it all onto a much more comfortable screen. You can of course cast your favourite YouTube videos via its app or show of the latest snapshots you’ve taken on your phone via smartphone mirroring. However, you can do even more. 
Got a ton of videos and movies in your notebook or PC? With your Chromecast and an app called Plex you can now stream all of them wherever you go. The initial setup might take a little time, but believe us, it’s worth it.  First, sign-up for an account with Plex  : Sorry folks, it is no longer free but for $4.99 it is worth it). Then download the Plex Media Server program and install it in your PC or notebook that contains all those videos and movies you have. Then all you have to do is add your video folders to Plex Media Server program it’s ready to go. After that all you have to do install the Plex app on your smartphone and sign-in to your account. Now you have access to all your movies and TV series on your PC or notebook and their even nicely indexed into an awesome Netflix like menu system, complete with synopsis.  Need your music fix? Just get the Spoticast app that’ll let you stream Spotify to the Chromecast. Once you’ve done that  you’ll have access to a plethora of tunes which you can cast directly to a TV for your listening pleasure as well.  Can’t stand doing a video call on your tiny smartphone screen? With the Chromecast you’ll turn your plain old Google Hangout video call into something more inclusive and comfortable with your large screen TV.  All you need to do is mirror your device onto the TV via the Chromecast app on your smartphone where it is able see everyone, then start your video call via Skype, Google Hangout or even Facetime. Remember for best effect, make sure your smartphone is in landscape mode so you’ll be able to enjoy a wider video view on the TV. Why bother with a remote when you have your smartphone? That’s right with the Chromecast, your trusty smartphone can control your TV. Do take note that this only works with TVs that support HDMI-CEC. Just enable the HDMI-CEC setting on your TV, make sure the Chromecast is connected and constantly powered, and voila, any device (in this case your smartphone) that is used to control the Chromecast now become the primary remote control for the TV.  Still confused what HDMI-CEC is? Well here’s a tip, it’s called something different depending on the brand. Samsung calls it Anynet +, LG calls it Simplink, Sony calls it Bravia Link, Toshiba calles it Regza Link and Panasonic calls it Viera Link.  Well you can now   from Maxis at only RM170 including GST and it’s open to everyone, not only existing Maxis customers.  If you’re a MaxiONE customer, there’s a treat in store for you as you can get it at a special price of RM150.

Finally after a year since Xiaomi has entered Malaysia, they have introduced the   which they consider to be their new flagship smart phone for the global market. Read on for our review of the Mi 4i. Looking at the spec-sheet alone, the Mi 4i is clearly a notch below its original Mi 4 flagship. Xiaomi wants you to believe that the “i” post fix stands for international, and in some ways it is true since it is only sold outside of China. In reality, the “i” stands more for “Lite” or a lower spec version as it runs on a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor with just 2GB of RAM. So why Xiaomi believes the Mi 4i deserves a flagship title? Well for starters, the display itself is a 5″ screen which is improved over the current Mi 4. While it pushes the same Full HD 1080 resolution, it gets additional Sunlight Display technology which automatically make adjustments on the pixel level to maintain visibility in sunny conditions.

Previously app developers would need to embark on several campaigns such as Search, Display ads, Youtube and etc but this would take up a lot of time to monitor and to manage each platform’s performance. At the end of the day, developers are looking at the most cost effective way to increase their app downloads and dealing with multiple ad networks can be a pain especially if time is hard to come by. Now Google has introduced its Universal App Campaigns, which offers a single platform to not only integrate Google’s ad networks (Search, Google Display Network, Admob, YouTube, Google Play Search), but also over 20 other mobile ad networks including InMobi and Millennial Media. You just need to set up a campaign once and the Universal App Campaigns will run across multiple channels and it will self optimise for the best results.

soyacincau,9 things you need to know about Android M,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/29/9-things-you-need-to-know-about-android-m/,"Android 6.0,Android M,Android M Developer Preview,Android M Features,Google I/O,Google I/O 2015","Android,Mobile OS",2015-05-29,"Google has given a quick developer preview of its next smart phone OS, the Android M. After the introduction of Lollipop last year with an all new Material Design, the new Android M focuses on greater control and improved user experience. Some of the features aren’t new for Android smart phones but it is good that they have included natively as a standard for all device manufacturers. Here are 9 key take outs on the new Android M after the break. Permissions are now made simpler, giving you better control over how apps are using your contacts, SMS, calendar, camera, microphone, GPS and etc. Currently on the native Android OS, the permissions are asked only upon installation which naturally most users would just accept all without thinking twice.  With Android M, the permission request will appear only when you try to access a specific feature. So for example in WhatsApp, it will ask you if would you would allow WhatsApp to use the mic before sending a voice message.  Even if you passed that phase, you can still manage permissions of each respective app or you can check permissions on the feature level, e.g. what apps can access your calendar, contact or camera. From here you can grant or revoke access according to your preference.  Several Chinese brands including Xiaomi and Huawei has integrated such features quite a while back in their Custom UI. It is good move that Google is making this a standard in the next release.  Several apps usually would have a built-in web browser in them. Especially like Facebook and Twitter where it prefers to load external links within its own app.  The problem is it doesn’t get the same session and experience as a full browser. At times, you would need to re-login repeatedly. With M, they are introducing Chrome Custom Tabs for a better Web Experience within an App. As long as you’re logged in, your session, sign ins, saved passwords, auto-fill and even translate will still work if the app opens up a link in a Chrome Custom Tab. While it looks like it is part of the app, the web browser is actually running off chrome with a customised appearance.  Usually when a user clicks a URL link, Android won’t necessary know whether to load it on a native app or via web browser. That’s where you get the usual prompt on how would you like to open the link and if it is for just one time only as shown above. On Google M, developers will be able to define what links that support their apps and google will then verify if that link truly belongs to the app. So if a user, clicks on a link, they will be redirected to the right app immediately for a better user experience.  Looking like a reboot of Google Wallet, Android Pay aims to make mobile payments simple, secure and open source. To make payment, it is as simple as unlocking your phone and tap using the NFC terminal. For better security, a virtual account number is used to transact with the merchant. Therefore it protects you from revealing your actual card number, minimising the risk of possible fraud.  Being an open platform, users can make payments using their official Android Pay app or via banking or shopping apps that support them. In theory, it works with any Android device with NFC but of course it all depends on the banks and merchants to support it on the local level. Fingerprint scanning has started to become mainstream and most implementations we’ve seen today like the Galaxy S6, Huawei Ascend Mate 7 and HTC One M9+ are proprietary solutions. Google is finally supporting fingerprint natively on Android M and it will become a standardised API for developers to tap into. Battery life is always a concern and Android M boast better standby power efficiency with Doze. When a device is put on standby, it detects with motion sensor to know if it is being left untouched or being carried around. If it knows it has been left unused on a bedside table, it goes into deeper sleep state for extended period of time. According to Google’s own internal test with a Nexus 9, Android M lasts up to 2 times longer in standby than Lollipop. Google M will also support USB Type C and they are pushing it as a standard on new devices with fast charging features. Since it is bi-directional, they are throwing a native feature where you can choose it to charge on cable, and you can reverse charge, turning your smart phone into a power bank with a USB OTG Cable.   
Google Now isn’t just your voice assistant but it knows you based on your activities, behaviour and now it gets even better. With “Now on Tap”, Google Now understands you by context no matter what you’re doing on your phone.  So if you’re listening to a song, you can simply ask Google Now, what’s is his real name, and it will return a search result wihout you giving a full specific question. Sometimes you won’t need to say a single word at all. For example if you’re reading an email about movie discussion, press and holding the button will automatically show details of the specific movie along with reviews and rating.  These are some of the new features on Android M which will be released officially in Q3 with its official confectionery or dessert name. Some other new improvements include a better word/text selection with floating options. For those who don’t like the new Lollipop volume controls, Android M will give individual controls for different sound sources such as ringer, media, notification and alarm from the volume rocker.  What do you think M would be? Macaron? M&M? Mars? Leave your comments down below.  If you missed last night’s Google I/O 2015 keynote, you can watch the replay of it below."

The cause? A   that looks like random mix of arabic and other characters. This is due to iOS difficulty of rendering them on the notification screen and pranksters are using this to annoy iOS users until an official fix is released. To prevent yourself from being a repeat victim, the folks at iMore had shared a   steps which you can take right now. Since the bug is triggered automatically from the notification screen, the obvious fix is to disable message notifications from appearing. For iPhone and iPad users, you can do this by heading over to Settings > Notifications > Messages, and disable “Show on Lock Screen”. The Apple Watch isn’t spared either, so you would need to do the same from the Apple Watch App under Notifications > Messages, and disable “Show Alerts”. Chances are, not many would be affected but who knows if you have that one friend who would take this opportunity to annoy you to the max.  If you do receive the troublesome line of unicode, you won’t be able to load the Messages app until you receive a fresh new message.

Like the  , it isn’t the first smart watch, but Apple is expected to bring something new to the table which hopefully sets a new standard on how a smart watch should be.  While availability of the Apple Watch is limited only to a handful of countries, we managed to get one from Sydney, Australia just to find out if it is any good. To recap, there are 3 versions available – The Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition. For the sake of trying it out, we got the cheapest of the lot, which is the Apple Watch Sport which costs us about RM1,600 (A$579) for the 42mm version.  If you’re wondering how is Apple packaging their wearable device, check out our unboxing after the break. Being a fashion item, Apple is taking a different route in packing their Watch. Unlike the usual one size fits all, Apple is packing each variant differently from each other. For the Apple Watch Sport which we have, it comes in a long box with the watch packed flatly inside a glossy looking case. Inside, you get 2 straps for different hand sizes but only 1 piece of its upper strap is provided. That means you get 3 rubber pieces in total, so you can’t   as a complete set.  Also included is a 1Amp charger and a magnetic charger which comes in glossy plastic white for the Apple Watch Sport. As comparison, the “Apple Watch” and “Apple Watch Editions” would come with a chrome looking magnetic charger which are boxed in a square case. The biggest difference compared to its more expensive variants is the build quality and type of glass. Being the entry model, the Watch Sport gets an aluminium body and toughen Ion-X glass which isn’t as scratch resistant as Sapphire.  So how’s the Apple Watch on a day to day basis? Watch out for our review coming right up. In the mean time, you can read our   of the entire range, including their most expensive variant that cost over RM67,000."

To find out, we set up a extreme low light scene and compared the Zenfone 2 with other new devices including the  ,   and the new  . You’ll be amazed with the results. Similar to its predecessor, the Low Light on the Zenfone 2 combines its nearby pixels to increase its brightness tremendously. As a result, the final image is lower in resolution, so instead of a 13MP photo, you’ll get a maximum of 3MP. In our set up, we took the shot in a box that’s almost pitch black to the naked eye. As you can see, the Low Light Mode difference is like night and day, as if the box was fully illuminated from the inside.  When compared to the other models, the Samsung Galaxy S6 with its f/1.9 fast lens performed better than the HTC One M9+ and Mi 4i but it is no where as bright as the Zenfone 2. The Mi 4i however fares not too far behind and it has less noise with its Handheld Twilight mode compared to its standard Auto mode. The HTC One M9+ is no better and if you look closely, the noise is much more noticeable. It gets even worse in Duo Camera mode where the noise gets even more exaggerated as seen in the original sample shot below. Note that all these shots are taken without flash.  Granted that the Low Light Mode is only usable if you have very steady hands and it won’t be practical when used normally in the clubs. Nevertheless, it is still a remarkable feat if you really want to capture in the dark."

For Android, navigation is less painful on a large screen thanks to the standard back and recent apps buttons.  If you’re wishing for something similar on your iPhone, it is now possible and all you’ll need is just a screen protector. Unbelievable but true, this screen protector called Halo Back on   can add a “back” button to your iPhone. How it works is quite magical and the idea is quite simple if you think about it. As our fingers conduct electricity, Halo Back essentially is a screen protector with an invisible circuit layer that connects the spot where the “Back” button is on the top of the display to empty spot placed towards the left of the home button. So if you’re tapping on that empty spot, it reacts as if you’re tapping the back button at the top.

Fast charging sure does help to minimise the waiting time but nothing beats having to use the device for a full day without the need of carrying a power bank.  Apart from optimising power consumption, the common solution is to fit a high capacity battery into a smart phone. Now Chinese maker Gionee, that has an obsession of making   has a different approach in mind. Like the teaser picture above suggests, Gionee thinks that having two batteries is better than one. Called as the M5, the new Gionee smart phone is said to feature 2 batteries inside. Without giving further details, Gionee reckons that it would provide up to 4 days of usage before requiring a charge. It isn’t clear if the 2 batteries are pushing the same power output or if they are of the same capacity. If Gionee can make a smart phone that’s both thin and enduring enough to last for 4 days, that would be an incredible feat which most users would drool over.  Apart from the M5, Gionee is preparing to launch its new Elife E8 that boasts a camera that can produce a 100MP image. Obviously there would be some software based resampling involved and it is said to be powered by a 2GHz Octa-Core MT6795 processor. We expect more details of its E8 and M5 to surface in the next couple of weeks before its announcement."

Rumours for an earlier Note 5 launch in July were quashed by Samsung Mobile’s head honcho J.K. Shin. The brand is still targeting for launch during IFA 2015 which is happening in September later this year, following a tradition of launching their Note devices at the trade show in Berlin. 
From what we already know,  the Galaxy Note 5 is expected to have a 5.7 inch display with either 2K or 4K resolution and the latest Exynos 7422 processor under the hood. The new unit is Samsung’s first all-in-one solution with an intergrated CPU, GPU, RAM, storage and modem combo all in one chip. But there are also rumours that the Note 5 could be running an Exynos 7430 processor as well. Also, Samsung has renamed Project Zen to Project Zero 2, which unlike the Galaxy Note 5 will not have S Pen support. This points towards perhaps a phablet version of the   as opposed to a direct replacement for the Galaxy Note edge. The model number for Project Zero 2 has also been confirmed to be SM-G928, which shares a similar model numbering to the current Galaxy S6 and S6 edge which have vastly different specs than the Note 5. Project Zero 2 is said to have a smaller 5.4 or 5.5 inch dual-curved Super AMOLED display and will be sporting a Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor under the hood. This means Samsung is still giving Qualcomm a chance to be in one of their flagships and due to it being a lower spec CPU. As such the price gap between the Note 5 and Project Zero 2 could be much smaller. Currently the price difference between the normal screen models of the Note and the “edge” variant is about RM 500, so could we be seeing a similar price gap between the Note 5 and Project Zero 2? Both devices are expected to make an appearance during IFA 2015, so stay tuned for more updates."

That’s not all, the new Spotify will serve tailored playlists that will take into account what your music listening history as well as the activity that you’re doing at a point in time. By offering new media offerings like video, news and podcasts, it seems like Spotify wants to be an all-in-one media jukebox. Currently they’ve partnered up with a bunch of media companies that include; ABC, Adult Swim, BBC, Comedy Central, E!, ESPN, Fusion, Maker Studios, MTV, NBC, RadioLab, Slate, TED, TWiT, Vice News and WNYC. The video content will be served in clip form, taken out from the popular shows and programs of the media partners. For example, it could come in the form of a short news clip from the BBC, a short stand-up routine from Comedy Central or excerpts or even full talks from TED. Spotify will also be offering podcasts and talk based audio clips. One example is BBC Minute a round-the-clock news service that is basically 60 second conversations of shareable news updated every half hour. All the new content and song library will be delivered in a new format of playlists that focus more on relevance rather than genres. Spotify will now take into account your age, location, media watching and listening history, then serve up a playlist that’ll be relevant to you for a particular time of a day.

Keeping to the tradition of being super slim, the OPPO R7 is not the thinnest of the lot but at 6.3mm it is still quite remarkable for what it is packing on the inside.

Under the hood the device sports a 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor mated to 3GB RAM as well as 16GB expandable storage.

soyacincau,Sony Xperia Z4 to launch in Hong Kong and Taiwan as the Xperia Z3+?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/22/sony-xperia-z4-to-launch-in-hong-kong-and-taiwan-as-the-xperia-z3/,"Android,Android 5.0 Lollipop,Sony,Sony Xperia Z3,Sony Xperia Z3 Plus,Sony Xperia Z4,Xperia,xperia Z3 plus","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sony",2015-05-22,"Sony has been under the radar lately and their latest flagship, the   was announced without much fanfare in Japan last month.

While the Xperia Z4 was launched as a Japan only device, it looks like they are making it available in more markets as Sony is organising a press event in Hong Kong and Taiwan sometime next week. According to the press invite, it reveals that it would be a new flagship with emphasis on top camera, screen, sound, water and design all rolled into one. Since the Xperia Z4 isn’t really perceived as an all new model, it might be called simply as the   outside of Japan. As Sony Mobile division is having some rough times, it makes more sense for them to focus on a single flagship per year cycle. The Xperia Z4/Z3+ is merely seen as a mid-life facelift and probably released at selected markets.  India apparently is   on 26th May and we’ll find out soon enough what this new flagship is all about. If there’s one model that Sony should release, it would be the replacement of its   phablet."
soyacincau,Compared: Top Smart Phones you can get for under RM800,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/21/compared-top-smart-phones-you-can-get-for-under-rm800/,"Acer liquid Jade Z,Acer Liquid Jade Z Malaysia,ASUS ZenFone 2,ASUS ZenFone 2 Malaysia,Comparison,Dual Sim,Honor 4X,Honor 4X malaysia,lenovo a7000,Lenovo A7000 Malaysia,Meizu m1 Note,Meizu m1 Note Malaysia,mi 4i,Mi4i,smart phone,Xiaomi Mi 4i,Xiaomi Mi 4i Comparison,Xiaomi Mi 4i Malaysia","Acer,Asus,huawei,Lenovo,Meizu,Mobile Devices,Xiaomi",2015-05-21,"The   has   for Malaysia and it packs quite a punch for just RM749. If you’re wondering what else you can get for the same price range, we’ve compared the Mi 4i with 5 other devices that come with 4G LTE.  Is the Mi 4i   you can get for less than RM800? Read on to find out. 
 In Malaysia, the current top contenders that are priced below RM800 include the   (RM739),   (RM619),   (RM749),  ,   (RM799) and the newly launched   (RM749). Just for clarity, the Zenfone 2 featured here is their mid-range ZE550ML which comes with a 5.5″ HD 720p display and lower 1.8GHz Intel Quad-Core processor with 2GB of RAM. 
If you’re into big screens, the first 4 models are having a larger display size of 5.5″ where as the Liquid Jade Z and Mi 4i is having a more compact 5″ screen. When you look at the screen resolution, the Meizu m1 Note and the Mi 4i are the only smart phones to offer Full HD 1920×1080 screen solution with pixel density of over 400ppi. Obviously the Mi 4i would be the sharpest as it packs the same amount of pixels in a smaller screen size than the m1 Note. 
To keep the price down, most brands tend to use alternative processors such as MediaTek, Intel or Hi-Silicon to deliver the best performance for your buck. We haven’t tried all 6 yet but from   with the Lenovo A7000, this could be the better performer in terms of benchmarks as it scored over 43,000 points on Antutu. The MediaTek MT6752m seems to be on par with a Galaxy S5’s Snapdragon 801 processor in benchmarks. As comparison, the Mi 4i with Qualcomm’s 2nd generation Snapdragon 615 processor claims that it would score slightly over 40,000 points on Antutu. In terms of RAM, all 6 are having 2GB RAM which is pretty decent in this category. 
Storage is quite a deal breaker for most users and these days it is hard to live on 8GB alone. On the list, the Meizu M1 Note, Zenfone 2, Liquid Jade Z and the Mi 4i are generous enough to pack 16GB of on-board storage. However out of these 4, only the Zenfone 2 and the Liquid Jade Z comes with a microSD expansion slot.  
As selfies being a mandatory requirement these days, all 6 phones are having a 5MP front camera. For main photography shots, all of them comes equipped with a 13MP main shooter except for the Lenovo A7000 which comes with a 8MP camera instead. For a more natural looking photos while using flash, the Meizu M1 note, Zenfone 2 and the Mi 4i comes with dual-tone LED flash. 
All devices here support dual-SIMs with 4G LTE connectivity but there’s a difference in the slots. Usually dual-SIM phones have their secondary slot restricted to just 2G only, so if you need to use the 2nd SIM for faster data, you would need to physically swap the SIM card onto the first slot for 4G. For the Honor 4X, Liquid Jade Z and Mi 4i, both slots support 4G so you can enjoy full speed connectivity regardless of which SIM is active for data. 
No matter how good the specs are, the battery is also a critical point for a smart phone. In this comparison, the m1 Note has the biggest battery at 3,140mAh and it is followed by closely with the Mi 4i with a 3,120mAh battery which is respectable for a 5″ device. For those who care about removable batteries, the A7000 is the only one here with the option. 
Among the 6, the Mi 4i is the most compact of the lot and it is the thinnest at just 7.8mm. In terms of weight, the Acer Liquid Jade Z is the lightest at only 110g but this comes as no surprise as it has the smallest battery capacity at 2,300mAh.  
If you’re getting a new phone, it is recommended to get one with the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop. Out of the box, the ASUS Zenfone 2, Lenovo A7000 and Xiaomi Mi 4i are running on Lollipop from the start. Eventually the other models are likely to be upgraded from Android 4.4 KitKat to Lollipop but the only question is when."

Earlier this year it was discovered that there were   floating around the market, with the brand themselves warning against buying the phones from non-legitimate sources. Now they’ve announced that they are in the process of cracking down on counterfeiters selling the cheaply priced clones and have published a video showing how to spot a fake OPPO N3. So far over 744 cases so far have been reported with fake phones ending up at OPPO’s service centers by the droves showing just how bad it has gotten. They have also put together a handy video detailing on how to spot a fake OPPO N3 versus the real deal side by side: So here are four ways to spot a fake OPPO N3. The differences in display from the original article and the fake are quite obvious, with the genuine 5.5 inch OPPO N3 using an IPS LCD display at 16M colours and 1080 x 1920 pixels and Colour OS 2.0 is sharp and crisp while the clone’s display is oddly tinted and has a lower resolution. The clone OPPO N3 does not have a motorised rotating lens that can be activated via onscreen gestures (pictured at the left) and has to be rotated manually while the genuine N3 can be automatically manipulated and has a 16 megapixel Schneider Kreuznach certified camera. The clone also only has a 5 megapixel rear camera and is missing the O-Touch key. On top of coming in a wrong sized box and sub par accessories, the genuine N3 (as pictured on the right) will have a VOOC Flash Charge and USB, quality earbuds, O-Click 2.0 Bluetooth remote as well as a fingerprint scanner on the back. In addition to the OPPO N3 using an non-removable battery, the inside of the fake device is very different from that of the actual article. The genuine N3 also uses a micro coaxial cable and double-sided printed circuit board (PCB) whereas the fake product as an unregistered and possibly dangerous battery as well as an easy to bend flexible printed circuit (FPC). You will also find single sided PCB with stickers in the fake holding the internals like it has been taped together. This is particularly dangerous because the parts are likely to have malfunctions and heating problems that could put you at risk due to their toxic nature or at very worse, literally explode. OPPO strongly recommends that you only buy their phones from their official retailers and partners to avoid injury or unknowingly buying fake products."

Similar to the iOS, the Watch OS is still quite basic for it’s first iteration. For example when the iPhone was initially launched it couldn’t even copy and paste which was a point of mockery for the device’s rivals, plus it didn’t even have an AppStore till iOS 2.0 was released. But this is set to change as a new software update will be teaching the Watch a bunch of new tricks, like Sleep Tracking and Find my Watch. While the security is already pretty decent, it’s getting further bumped up with the Find my Watch feature and possibly a proximity alert for your iPhone should the Watch get out of range. Among the updates is a new health features that allows the hardware to measure your Blood Oxygen Saturation but the function is disabled for the time being. All of the new updates are great but we do hope they could do something about the battery life not being capable of going past a full day. Another possibility is Apple opening up widgets to 3rd party app developers and who knows, they allow custom watch face designs that could be sold on the AppStore.  The update is likely to be announced at the   Apple Developers Conference on June 8th in San Francisco. To find out more about what the Apple Watch can do, check out our on the device."

If you’re looking for the cheapest smart phone with Lollipop, Acer has an entry level smart phone that runs with it below RM300. The trio of new smartphones are none other than the Acer Liquid Z220, Z520 along with the higher end Liquid Jade Z. The Acer Liquid Jade Z is the successor of the original  , and is the sleekest of the lot at just 7.9mm thin and weighs just 110 grams.

The Acer Liquid Z220 on the other hand is Acer’s budget offering that runs on a dual-core Snapdragon 200 processor mated to 1GB RAM and 8GB expandable memory up to 32GB. Going down a notch, it gets a 4 inch WVGA display at 800×480, 5 megapixel rear camera with flash and a rather small 1,300mAh battery. Surprisingly the Z220 is also Acer’s first smartphone to sport Android 5.0 Lollipop.  At RM299, it is probably the cheapest Lollipop device to be launched in Malaysia so far. Compared even with the   (VGA front camera), the Liquid Z220 has a better 2MP front shooter with a 89 degree wide angle lens for better selfies."

Much better than getting an RM 100 rebate for an iPhone 4. You can view the revamped value list below.

For the R7, they have turned to Samsung for what they claimed to be a much superior camera experience. OPPO is fitting a main 13MP rear camera on the R7 that uses ISOCELL CMOS sensor for faster, more accurate and stable shots. If you’re wondering where have you heard about ISOCELL, this is the same Samsung camera technology that was  . Some of the key advantages include less noise from cross talk with fine barriers between each pixels and a better dynamic range for greater details.  Other enhancements for better photography include a dual-drive Hybrid Focus system and an Anti-Shake optimisation. OPPO added that its R7 main camera could focus as quick as 0.1 seconds and it initiates 30% faster than other devices. To avoid missing a clear shot, the Anti-Shake optimisation starts taking a burst of multiple shots before you press the shutter and it continues to take more even after you released the button. After that, it will pick the best photo that is perceived to be the clearest from the batch.  In addition, the 13MP ISOCELL camera is also paired with Schneider-Kreuznach designed lens, a renowned German optical manufacturer. Meanwhile at the front, it gets a higher resolution 8MP shooter for clearer and detailed selfies.  On the software side, the OPPO R7 gets a Pure Image 2.0+ image processor where it gets extra features such as taking higher resolution photos up to 50MP, Super Macro and much more.

What if you had a GoPro enabled drone that could pilot itself? This is the Lily, the only drone with a built-in camera that you can throw up into the air and have it follow you to capture life’s greatest adventure.  The Lily can fly at 25 miles per hour and shoot 1080p video or 720p at up to 120 fps while keeping it’s eyes on you. It can also shoot 12 megapixel still shots and 360 degree panoramas. Just toss it into the air for the ultimate selfie. The drone will even detect when you’re kicking some sick moves and automatically goes into slow mo mode. The Lily does this by following a small tracker you wear on your wrist (or anywhere else on the target) and with this you issue some simple commands for it work. The tracker doesn’t work as a traditional remote control however, and there’s no way for you to pilot it manually, but it more than makes up for it with it’s own piloting skills. So in that sense, it’s more of a flying camera than an actual honest-to-goodness drone. The device has a range of a hundred feet, a 20 minute battery life on a single charge and is totally waterproof. You can even watch footage live on your phone using their mobile app. Unfortunately, it’s not cheap and it carries a $499 (about RM 1783) price tag if you pre-order it and $999 (about RM 3570) on retail if you decide to try snagging one for yourself.

It is 2015 and high-end 5″ smart phones should come with at least 3,000mAh capacity batteries for an all-day usage. Even with Samsung’s optimised display, processor and storage, we only managed to get about 11-14 hours of average use per charge on the Galaxy S6 edge (2,600mAh battery). For taking pictures, HTC is throwing everything they’ve got with a main 20.2MP Duo Camera set up similar to the One M9+. Selfie lovers would be in for a treat, as there’s a front shooter with higher 13MP unit. At the front, you also get HTC’s famed Boom Sound stereo speakers enhanced with Dolby Audio and out of the box, it runs on the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop. Overall, the Butterfly 3, which is called as the J Butterfly in Japan weighs 162 grams with a thickness of 10.1mm. That’s slightly lighter by a mere 6 grams than the metal clad One M9+.  There are 3 colour options available – Red, White and Indigo Blue which comes with a glossy polycarbonate back. At the moment it is released only in Japan and it is expected to be made available internationally in the months to come."

Apart from having the best spec in each iteration, most power users would appreciate its removable battery and the option of adding a microSD if needed. This however changed when they introduced its   and  . Opting for premium build quality and aesthetics, the new Samsung flagship has dropped most of its expansion options, which is a let down for certain die hard fans.  Coming from the neighbouring camp in South Korea, the   has emerged and it seems to be a formidable rival for Samsung. Does it stand a chance against the Galaxy S6? Read on to find out.  Recently we managed to try out the new G4 in its Metal Grey body. The back which undoubtedly is plastic is laden with subtle polygon patterns underneath a metallic looking surface. In the hands, it reminds us of the   series and overall we like the look and feel of it. True to LG’s own tradition, it gets a rear mounted rocker button that sits underneath its camera. For those who want to stand out with something more upmarket, there’s also a leather back variant which is made out of Genuine Leather with striking stitching that runs down in the middle.  At the front, it gets a similar 5.5″ Quad HD display as its former  . However it is improved with greater colour range and brightness with its IPS Quantum Display. In comparison with the Galaxy S6, it is equally as sharp and colour wise it looks more natural without the exaggerated saturation that’s apparent with Super AMOLED displays. The front of the G4 does arc slightly but it isn’t as obvious as its curvy G Flex 2. Under the hood, it runs on a Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM along with 32GB of storage. While it isn’t the top ranging Snapdragon 810 that’s powering the  , the LG G4 feels rather smooth. Sure it won’t be beating the Galaxy S6 phenomenal benchmark scores but it feels more than capable to handle anything you throw at it. We kinda like the flat interface of LG’s UX 4.0 that runs on top of a newer Android 5.1 Lollipop. Compared to Samsung’s TouchWiz, LG’s UX 4.0 feels lighter and it is a refreshing take on Android’s pure Material Design. As usual, you get the LG gesture tricks like Knock Code, where you can unlock your device with a preset knocking patterns. This allows you to wake the device without having the reach for its buttons, and they had to do this since the buttons are all placed at the back.   Probably one of the killer features is the camera. While it sports a similar 16MP camera with Optical Image Stabiliser, the LG G4 edges over the Galaxy S6 with a faster f/1.8 lens. This allows more light which on paper is a better shooter in low light conditions. For greater colour accuracy, there’s even a Colour Spectrum sensor that’s located right underneath its flash light. The Galaxy S6 has incredible camera and LG seems to have taken it up a notch by offering heaps of manual controls including focus and even shutter speed. For selfie fans, the front gets a higher 8MP camera that even has its own soft flash. To capture the perfect selfie, it could take several snaps of you doing different poses in a sequence and then pick the best shot after that. Overall the camera is snappy and the focus is also immediate with multi-point selection on-screen like a dSLR.  If you’re looking for a flagship, it has to have top notch performance, an incredible camera and the looks to stand out. In that respect, the LG G4 has the means to give the Galaxy S6 some serious challenge. Not forgetting of course is the ability to add even the largest 200GB microSD card and a user replaceable 3,000mAh battery, which are the two of the biggest things most power users would want in a high-end device.  It is just a pity that LG Malaysia isn’t showing any indication of offering the LG G4 in Malaysia. In  , the LG G4 is priced at $928 (about RM2,518) for the Metallic model and $998 (about RM2708) for the Leather version. If you want to get one in Malaysia, you’ll have to fork out   for an imported unit."

Prepaid Reloads will be exempted from GST,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/13/no-more-fumbling-over-coins-prepaid-reloads-will-be-zero-rated/,"gst,gst malaysia,GST Top Up,Malaysia Prepaid,Malaysia Prepaid Tax,prepaid,Prepaid Reload,Prepaid Reload GST,Prepaid Top up GST,Sales Tax","Industry in General,Players on the Field",2015-05-13,"When   came into effect on 1st April, Malaysian consumers were up in arms over the extra 6% charge on prepaid reloads. There was   as Deputy Finance Minister Ahmad Maslan retorted that there shouldn’t be any price increase. The fact is prepaid services should have been   with service charge which the telcos have been absorbing all these while. There’s no running away from GST as even postpaid users have always been paying the extra 6% tax on their monthly bills. After taking charge of the prepaid reload issue, Communications and Multimedia Minister, Datuk Seri Ahmad Shabery Cheek has finally announced a solution which would hopefully put the matter to rest. The minister announced that all prepaid reloads will not be imposed with GST. So if you buy a RM10 top up, you’ll get RM10 value with no extra charge upon purchase. However that doesn’t mean prepaid is free from GST. Instead the 6% tax will be charged only upon usage. Essentially this is similar to buying shopping vouchers at the supermarkets and you’ll only be charged GST upon purchase. You can’t avoid GST but this implementation is actually fairer to consumers. Currently consumers are paying GST upfront even before the service is being used. Furthermore not all mobile usage would attract GST charges, for example usage overseas for roaming internet and calls are actually exempted from GST. In the current system, prepaid users would have already paid GST when they roam as the 6% tax was already paid upfront regardless of what you plan to do with your credit.   All GST are paid the moment you top up.  : For GST on roaming using prepaid,  ,   and   mentions that GST will be refunded. In Digi’s FAQ it states that users will be notified of the refund the next day while Xpax shall rebate back at the end of the day in Malaysian time. Whereas for postpaid users, data or voice calls during roaming would be GST exempted and you only pay GST for taxable usage when you receive your bill. The only impact is that your mobile rates would increase by 6%. So a typical 10sen/minute would be charged at 10.6sen/minute and RM10 service add-on for data would cost RM10.60. At least it is fair that you only pay upon consuming your credit.  However the biggest question is whether or not the telcos would round up the extra 6% charge. Because if they do, you’ll end up with less credit in the long run (e.g. Being charged 11 sen instead of 10.6 sen). Currently our local banks are charging GST for its services and they round up the 10 sen Interbank GIRO charges to 11 sen inclusive of GST. The ministry has given telcos 6 months to comply with the latest change and they urge them to lower down their rates to minimise the impact of the cost increase. Currently some prepaid players have taken some steps such as giving free calls or credit. One of the notable initiatives we’ve seen so far is from   where they give free RM10 credit if you top up RM30 and free RM20 if you top up RM50. What do you guys think? Will this end the GST prepaid debacle once and for all?"

This is the successor of its current   that’s super thin at 4.85mm and it carries over the similar durable stainless steel frame and back.  Ahead of its global announcement, the OPPO R7 has just passed our Malaysian SIRIM certification with the model R7f. From the little certification details, the R7 has dual-SIM slots and it will support 4G LTE in both 1800MHz and 2600MHz.  Just to recap what OPPO has revealed so far, the R7 appears to be similar with the current R5 but it gets a couple of new additions. At the front, there’s a physical home button which is probably the first for OPPO. There’s a possibility that the home button could double up as a one touch fingerprint scanner for easier unlocking.  For the front, it gets a 2.5D screen which has a slight rounded edges at the sides that’s similar to the iPhone 6 and Galaxy Note 4. Being an R series, you can expect this to be super slim but it may not be as thin as their current R5. If they are plan to push this as a flagship, OPPO should considering putting a larger battery capacity into this one. As usual, you can expect OPPO’s VOOC rapid charging technology which does 0-75% in just 30 minutes.  With the device being certification in our local SIRIM database, it looks like Malaysia would be among the first wave countries to receive it after its global announcement. The OPPO R7 is said to be   in May."

Those days are long behind us, the times when you were stuck with whatever software was on your feature phone, and almost always there would be Snake. Now the game is making a comeback for touchscreen phones thanks to Nokia engineer Taneli Armanto who was originally responsible for putting the game on the Nokia 6110 and developer Rumilus Design for a fresh take on good ol’ Snake. The game has been aptly named “Snake Rewind” both as a revisiting to classic Snake as well as one of the game’s mechanics that lets you “rewind” if you happen to Game Over. Graphics are quite minimalistic but sports a lot of special effects that are more commonplace in today’s games. It also looks like there will be a healthy mix of old and new features, with missions you can complete in the game as well as visual modes that imitate Snake from past and present, so if you fancy playing Snake on a Cathode Tube screen or exactly the way it was on the Nokia 6110 you can do so.can do just that. No news yet on how much the game is going to be priced, but it looks like it might be a freemium game because you seem to be able to purchase rewinds. Snake REwind is expected to crop up on Windows Phone, Android and iOS app stores on 14th May. In the meantime, check out the game trailer below."

It made headlines being the first equipped with the biggest amount of RAM you could find on a smartphone. In terms of looks, the Zenfone 2 looks pretty much like the rest of the family with its metallic back and general styling, with the smartphone coming in at a 3.9mm thickness at its thinnest point. They’ve also deviated a bit from its flat rectangular back to a slightly curved design that is supposed to be easier and more comfortable to hold and therefore harder to lose your grip. Also new is a rear mounted control just underneath the camera that can be used to snap selfies or adjust the volume. There are 3 distinctive versions of the Zenfone 2 that are hitting the market, with the higher end Zenfone 2 (ZE551ML) being home to a 5.5” full IPS screen, monstrous 4GB RAM, quad-core 64-bit 2.3GHz Z3580 Atom processor, 32GB storage and a 13 MP f/2.0 rear cam and 5 MP front snapper with a generously sized 3,000 mAh battery on top of dual SIM capabilities. There’s also a larger 64GB storage version available if you must have that extra storage. The Zenfone 2 (ZE550ML)’s slightly lower end sibling is just a notch below with a 1.8GHz Z3560 quad-core processor, 2GB RAM and a 5.5” 720p IPS display but otherwise shares the rest of the phone’s qualities. Both phones will be running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ZenUI 2.0 on top and will get an extra 5GB ASUS web storage. At the lower end of the spectrum, there’s the ZE500CL which comes with a smaller 5″ HD 720p display and it runs on an older 1.6GHz Z2560 processor that’s powering the previous Zenfone series. The specs internally are a notch down with a 8MP main and 2MP front cameras, while the battery is smaller as well at 2,500mAh.  While the phone itself isn’t something ridiculously innovative, it does have a few aces up its sleeve. Aside from having a crazy amount of RAM that would no doubt make it capable of handling high load apps, it also has one of the better cameras we’ve seen on a smartphone. It’s got enough modes to satisfy any shutter bug and the HDR mode makes quick work of photos that would otherwise look overexposed in bad lighting. For demanding situations, there’s a Super Resolutions mode where it combines 4x 13MP photos to produce a clearer picture with greater detail while reducing noise. The Zenfone 2 has officially launched in Malaysia and they are priced as follows: 
ZE500CL (5″ HD, 1.6GHz Z2560, 2GB RAM, 8GB ROM) – RM599 
ZE550ML (5.5″ HD, 1.8GHz Z3560, 2GB RAM, 16GB ROM) – RM749 
ZE551ML (5.5″ FHD, 1.8GHz Z3560, 2GB RAM, 32GB ROM) – RM899 
ZE551ML (5.5″ FHD, 2.3GHz Z3580, 4GB RAM, 32GB ROM) – RM1,099 
ZE551ML (5.5″ FHD, 2.3GHz Z3580, 4GB RAM, 64GB ROM) – RM1,299 Also launched alongside the ZenFone 2 earlier in Jakarta is a few new accessories that aren’t the same steak and potatoes you usually see when it comes down to cases and camera goodies. For starters assortment of optional back covers are certainly a breath of fresh air, taking full advantage of textures and shapes to make some rather unique covers both visually and physically. The shapes are available in five designs, with two symmetrical patterns and three asymmetrical patterns to choose from. Speaking of covers, they’ve also released an updated version of their flip cover, called the View Flip Cover Deluxe which has a larger view port than its predecessors and pretty much functions in such a way that you can go about your business without having to open the lid for basic functions. It’s essentially the same as the original View Flip Cover, with the exception that the cover seems more snugly fit to the phone and you can access more features via the ring of commands accessible from the window.  Some might find the cover very convenient with the added bonus of saving power by not having to utilize the entire screen but for functions besides what is available (like settings, camera, music and so on) you will still have to pop it open. The recent regional event also saw the launch of two new camera accessories as well as a powerbank; namely the ZenFlash, LolliFlash and the ZenPower 10050mAh powerbank. The aptly named ZenFlash is a rear mounted camera accessory that supposedly is able to turn your ZenFone 2 into a high end DSLR-like camera. It attaches via a set of suction cups which in turn sticks to a special sticker you attach to the rear the ZenFone, and the Xenon flash is 100x times brighter than the ZenFone 2’s own LED flash. It does give a huge boost to the details of photos taken in low lighting conditions and connects to the phone via the microUSB slot. Accompanying it is the circular LolliFlash which we hope is named after it’s similarity to a colourful lollipop, that affixes to the headphone jack of the phone. Its purpose is to act as a dual-toned LED torch to get more natural toned selfies, but also comes with a set of three colour filters in white, blue and purple that also function as protective covers for the device. The LolliFlash is priced at 119,000 Rupiah (about RM 33) which makes it a really cheap plug in flash for your phone that hardly puts a dent in your wallet, while the ZenFlash will retail for about RM 67. About the size of a business card, the   is not just small but it can juice even bigger devices thanks to a higher 2.4A output that charges quicker than standard 2.1A based powerbanks. The only thing we’d say is missing is a dual USB charging setup but for something this small being able to hold enough juice (10,050mAh) to power up your smartphone multiple times a day, it sounds pretty good to us. The powerbank is unfortunately only available for the Indonesian market at the moment, but it would be great if they make it available over the entire region given that it could make for a good competitor for Xiaomi’s super affordable powerbanks of the same capacity. In Indonesia, the ZenPower costs 269,000 Rupiah which is about RM75. Of course, prices could be very different if they get a local launch in Malaysia."

With its incremental alphabet naming convention, the next version would start with the letter M and it would take probably a few months before they reveal its final name.  For the Android M, Google is appears to be focusing on improved notification and greater voice controls beyond the typical “OK Google”. So far no word on the design but we reckon they would be some subtle tweaks from its current   that was introduced with Lollipop.  About the same time last year, Android L was   during Google I/O 2014 and it was officially   in October. That’s also the same time they had announced its   phablet and   tablet which came with Lollipop out of the box. In terms of OS adoption rate, Lollipop is still far from dominating the Android platform. At the  , Android 5.0 Lollipop takes 9% of total Android devices, while the latest Android 5.1 having just 0.7%. Most devices, close to 40% are still running on Android 4.4 KitKat and the biggest hurdle comes from device makers that are slowly pushing updates to its current handsets.  With the Chinese brands aggressively pushing cheap and cheerful handsets, they are notoriously known for slow software updates. Only recently we are seeing new devices being announced with Lollipop out of the box but there’s still no visibility of them upgrading their current KitKat flagships to Lollipop. In their home market, software updates for these Chinese brands doesn’t seem to be a priority as personalised themes and UI are more critical in their home market. As comparison, the mainstream brands such as HTC, Sony and Samsung have already pushed Lollipop updates internationally even for last year’s models. With Android M coming up soon, the software gap will increase if manufacturers don’t keep up with the latest updates.  Google I/O 2015 is   on 28th May and it will be streamed live over YouTube. If you want to know what’s in store for Android, this is one event you won’t want to miss."

But what really makes it special here is the 2.5D glass display which is a 5.2 inch 1080p screen that has a 0.8mm bezel which uses some optical sorcery to reflect the on-screen content to give it a bezel free look.

The Exclusive edition of the phone also gets their new TIO patented fingerprint tech on the power and volume rockers that can be used to unlock the phone.

In an interview with Engadget, its VP for Global, Hugo Barra explained that the decision is made for the sake of user experience.  He emphasised that microSD cards are incredibly prone to failure and the availability of cheap and unreliable cards had made the situation worse. In most cases, inferior cards cause performance issues, instability and crashes which will eventually frustrate their users. As a result, most people would blame it on the device for a terrible experience without considering that the root of the problem lies on the expandable storage.  Xiaomi isn’t the only one having the stand against microSD. Even Google has offered no microSD slots on its Nexus devices, except for its first model, the Nexus One which was made by HTC. Google’s Martias Duarte   while microSD cards are ideal for users, they are actually confusing for users. For example when saving photos, videos and documents, users have to decide where does it go. Later on, they might not know if it is stored on the phone or on the card. He concluded that the overall experience to deal with microSD cards for the normal user is just too complicated. Despite that, the Android OS itself still supports microSD storage and it depends on manufacturers to offer it. If you look at the current flagship options, there are many that have started ditching the microSD card with Samsung being the latest candidate on the Galaxy S6. For Samsung, their reason is on aesthetics as well as performance. Their new flagship utilises a   storage which is almost 3X faster than standard eMMC 5.0 storage and having a microSD card might be a bottleneck for its performance. Other players that opt-out from having a microSD slot on their flagship include Motorola, OnePlus and even Meizu. For those who insists on having an expandable storage, you still have LG, Sony Xperia, Huawei and HTC that supports it. Interestingly Xiaomi does offer microSD expansion on their Redmi series but that’s obviously due to its tiny 8GB of storage which simply isn’t enough. However the usage of microSD for the Redmi was   and eventually they allowed you to save photos, videos and music directly onto the microSD instead of its internal storage.  The reason of simplifying the user experience seems sound and this somewhat affirms Apple’s tradition of having no expandable storage since day one of its iPhone. However if that’s the case, Xiaomi should really consider raising the minimum storage of their flagship models to at least 32GB. 16GB is simply not enough these days as the base operating system and native apps would have take up nearly 6GB on a fresh device. They do have larger 64GB version of their Mi 3, Mi 4 and even the Mi Pad but Xiaomi has hardly offered them outside of China. In the case for OnePlus, at least they did better by   when they launched in Malaysia.   While cloud storage seems to be the future, mobile internet connectivity isn’t exactly seamless for this to work especially in developing markets that Xiaomi is in. If you’re stuck with just 16GB of storage and with no microSD slot, your only option left is to get one of those  . What do you think? Is the microSD slot a critical factor in a flagship smart phone?"

The first one I’ve played with was the Compaq TC1000 which essentially is a laptop with a rotatable touch screen display.

Most recently they have finally nailed it with its Surface line up and the latest   was introduced with the bold claim of being a tablet that could replace your laptop. Starting from RM2,729 excluding the keyboard, the Surface Pro 3 is on the high side, especially when you can get a decent spec laptop for less. So if you’re looking for a cheaper alternative, here comes the Microsoft Surface 3 that’s priced from under RM2,000. Not only it is cheaper but it is also the thinnest and lightest Surface yet.  The past non-Pro Surfaces are pretty basic with a rather limited Windows RT. While it looks the same, it doesn’t give you the full Windows experience like installing Windows based application. For the new iteration, the Surface 3 runs on Windows 8.1 and you can install programs like your everyday PC."

Based on the info they have obtained at the event, the ZenFone 2 will be priced as follows: Compared to  , Malaysians will get an even lower spec version for the entry-level option with a smaller 5″ display and it runs on an older Intel Atom Z2560 processor. This is similar to the current   that’s priced at RM559. For its mid-range model, the ZE551ML with a 1.8GHz Intel Atom Z3560 processor is similar to Indonesia’s spec at RM749 but we also get a larger 32GB capacity option at RM899, which is quite generous for its price.   For those wanting the best performance, the top end ZE551ML model with a faster 2.3GHz Z3580 processor and 4GB of RAM can be yours at RM1,099 for 32GB and RM1,299 for 64GB storage. ASUS is not only the first smart phone maker to introduce a smart phone with 4GB of RAM, but they are also priced lower compared to the competing mid-range smart phones.  Can the Taiwan manufacturer fend off competition from its mainland Chinese rivals? Looking at the price and specs alone, the answer is probably yes. Lets hope that ASUS Malaysia has enough stock to go around. The Malaysian ASUS ZenFone 2 launch is   on 9th May."

The   was announced during MWC 2015 and it offers a 5.0″ Full HD display with Qualcomm’s high-end Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. However the One that’s coming to Malaysia is the   that was   earlier this month. As   a while back, we are getting just the One M9+ and HTC isn’t bringing the 5″ One M9 into local market. Is the M9+ better since it has the + sign? Well it all depends on what you’re looking for.  Despite the plus sign, the One M9+ is slightly bigger at 5.2″ but it does a higher Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440, which pushes a pixel density 534ppi. As comparison, the 5″ One M9 settles for a full HD 1920×1080 resolution that gives it a pixel density of 441ppi. Under the hood, the One M9+ runs on a 2.2GHz MediaTek MT6795 Octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM and HTC reckons that it shouldn’t differ much in actual usage compared to Qualcomm’s top end Snapdragon 810 series processor. On-board it gets 32GB of on-board storage which is also expandable with microSD up to 128GB. Another key difference is the main camera as the One M9+ get an additional secondary unit, making it a duo-camera set up with a 20MP unit. Meanwhile at the front, it gets 4MP Ultrapixel camera for selies and a fingerprint scanner on a capacitive home button that’s placed right smack in the middle of its boom sound speaker grill. Despite going slightly bigger in size, the One M9+ retains the same 2,840mAH capacity battery as the original One M9.  Another drawback of the One M9+ is its lower Cat4 4G LTE support, instead of Cat9 4G LTE with the One M9 (with Carrier Aggregation). From what we are told, the One M9 is only heading towards developed markets while the rest including Malaysia, India and China would be getting the One M9+ instead."

The affected app, SeaNav US has been around for close to 2 years now and they have been supporting the Pebble Smart Watch all these while. It appears that there’s a new policy to forbid app developers from mentioning any support for other mobile platforms, which is baffling considering Pebble isn’t exactly a competing mobile platform to start with.  To make matters worse, Apple responded to the developer and had pointed out its “support for the Pebble Smartwatch” description as being inappropriate on the app store. The following is the response from Apple: It is as if Apple is trying to force developers to support the Apple Watch by suppressing other competing watches from thriving on their platform. Looking at the response, these apps can continue to provide support for the Pebble Watch but they are not allowed to mention it anywhere on the app description, which is just plain oppressive. In SeaNav US app situation, what’s interesting is that the rejected app submission includes support for their new Apple Watch.  No doubt this is bad news for Pebble users on iOS and the reality is that there’s nothing much Pebble or its developers can do to turn this around.

And if P1 has only one point to make, loud and clear to you, it would be this – the challenger operator is making a comeback. Network performance, customer service quality and trust issues are just some of the many things that need fixing at P1, and the two foremost executives in the company – Kelvin Lee and Azizi A. Hadi – know exactly what to do to turn P1 around. Kelvin Lee is no stranger to P1, having been part of the Green Packet family for a good ten years. In 2011, Kelvin was asked by CC Puan, the CEO of P1, to join P1 in the role of Chief Commercial Officer to manage the sales and customer services of P1’s products and services. A veteran in Green Packet and P1, Kelvin has been through it all. And yet, the upbeat, approachable techie, is more energetic than ever, ready to transform P1 to become one of the country’s most innovative mobile operator. His optimism and energy is understandable, Kelvin has an experienced point man watching his guard. Azizi in his role as P1’s COO, is a new joiner but is no stranger to the telco industry given his wealth of experience in TM for the past eight years covering various roles from oversight of migrating from a digital to fully IP network, the HSBB (high speed broadband) rollouts to the SME business segment management. Kelvin and Azizi believe that P1, with full support from,   and SK Telecom, two giants from the telecommunications world – both with considerable investments in P1 – and a team of experts that’s now more pumped up than ever, is now in the best position to shake up the telecommunications space in Malaysia with the promise of being country’s first ever fully converged telecommunications provider. But what does this mean to you? Are you ready for a fully converged telecommunications provider? Watch as Kelvin and Azizi explain why 2015 is going to be the year for P1 and you. Let’s make things clear from the start, P1 has had some real issues in the past. Network issues, customer service issues, financial issues, you name it, P1 has it. Having seen it all, Kelvin openly admits, P1 has had its setbacks. “When P1 started, it provided a great product and service, but as a small company trying to operate against huge, established competitors we hit some bumps along the way. It was with good intentions P1 created a new service, but it had initial teething troubles with expanding coverage and increasing bandwidth,” “Financial difficulties also halted further expansion of P1’s coverage towers, which is why some people may have experienced moments of congestion and didn’t see their coverage area expanded.” However, the company doesn’t want to dwell in the past. The leadership acknowledges that it has made some mistakes but now it wants to get rid of the skeletons in the closet and start from afresh. It wants to build an ideal network that combines the best and latest in mobile data and find areas to converge with TM on fixed line internet technology to deliver telecommunications beyond what its competitors can muster. But in the hyper-competitive mobile telecommunications market, it’s understandable that Kelvin is keeping his cards close to his chest. “P1 realised there were issues to overcome and has spent a long time coming up with solutions that are now being put into place. These problems are now being fixed in the near future. That’s all I can say on that so watch this space.” Azizi shares the same opinion saying that customer satisfaction is paramount at P1 but for changes to take effect, he asks for time. “Changes are being made from the ground up, at the employee level. We’re growing customer service and we have some ideas that we’re going to set-up that will truly set us apart from competitors, for the better. We can’t say any more than that, except that it requires a bit of time, but it’s absolutely a priority, and it’s going to make us very different from the other big telcos in Malaysia.” Back in 2008, P1 was an ambitious brand, one that stuck it to the big boys, a brand that showed that a little guy can have the courage to fight, and to win – well, almost. When P1’s went online in late 2008, there weren’t many other mobile broadband offerings available in Malaysia that could match what P1 could deliver. P1’s, back then, cutting edge WiMAX network delivered speeds that competing 3G networks couldn’t match. And then, there’s the value proposition. Pair the pure performance of WiMAX with attractive pricing that was unlike anything that market could offer, it wasn’t long before P1 became the buzzword in wireless internet to a point where the brand saw demand far exceeding what its network could deliver. P1 was a victim of its own success. The bright spark in wireless communications that was flying high took a hit. Having lived with these growing pains, Kelvin acknowledged the issues that P1 faced in the past but it is the same issues that made the company more resilient and better. “We did something no operator dared. A new operator, using a completely new technology, we knew that things were going to be challenging for but we also knew that we can be successful. We know that we had the right stuff. Being the entrepreneurs that we are, we’ve simply had to revamp our strategy. With the collective support of strong parent companies, we now have a way forward. We want to win back the hearts of our customer, earning their trust. The only way to do this is by pure hard work.” Azizi agrees and adds that network is something that P1 really needs to build a wonder network, one that really needs to match the best that its competitors can offer and then some. “We need to ensure that the service levels for the existing 4G offering are increased to live up to high customer expectations – before we can introduce new products and services this year with LTE. To do this, we first have had to invest into the 4G network sufficiently to cater for a 99.7% uptime. In parallel, we’re also investing into the customer service representative head count – an increase by a further 50%. The goal is to be able to consistently respond to a customer enquiry within 48 hours of it being raised via the numerous official communication channels.” Beyond everything else, P1 knows that the road to its success is one where happy customers walk, and that’s where the combined expertise of TM and SK Telecom will be critical. TM is now the controlling shareholder in P1 with a 55.3% stake. The investment into P1 allows TM to take a step into the next chapter of its play book, i.e. for mobility solution offerings to complement its fixed broadband leadership position to support future cross-selling and up-selling. Could Malaysians dream of potentially having a single provider and a single bill and a single point of contact covering the triple play offering of fixed home broadband, IPTV as well as for mobile broadband services? The dream looks promising. As for SK Telecom’s role in this tripartite investment, Kelvin elaborated “They have been a strategic investor in P1 since 2010. SK Telecom is a telecom and technology powerhouse with over 14 million people reaping the rewards of the LTE Advanced network in South Korea. That’s over 50% of the LTE subscriber base in South Korea!” This puts P1 in a prime position to deliver what is possibly one of the best mobile networks in the country, possibly the world. Clearly, P1 is set to take on Malaysia once again with LTE in 2015. Will it be different this time around compared to 2008 when P1 dared to take on TM with 4G? Especially given the likes of Maxis, Celcom and DiGi who have had a head start of some years in this space, which is not something to underestimate. But the future is looking bright for P1. Given P1’s combined forces with big brother TM, the ability to leverage the vast backbone infrastructure links and the deep pockets means that P1 is off to a good start. If TM’s proven ability to roll out HSBB in record time in Malaysia could also rub-off on P1’s LTE rollout, we may well see a viable in the LTE space as early as the second half of 2015 making it exciting for you. The best part is yet to come. The anticipation of the technology advantage that SK Telecom brings to P1 could be the secret sauce that will enable P1 to offer a differentiation from its competitors. Without quite letting the cat out of the bag about what is in store for consumers with the introduction of LTE in 2015, Kelvin suggested that we look at the innovations that SK Telecom has brought about in South Korea with the applications and services that extend across every area of a person’s digital lifestyle, from seamless entertainment, to secured payment to high definition voice to give us a view of what to expect with P1 in the future."

It will also be running on Tizen and very likely one of Samsung’s Exynos chips as well. We still don’t have a real look at what the watch could be like yet, but it’s very likely to head down the same premium-wearable route as the Gear S."

According to serial leakster  , the Galaxy Tab S2 will have the dimensions of 237.17mm x 169.58mm x 5.5mm, which is more compact and thinner than the current Galaxy Tab S at 6.6mm. He also added that the new high-end tablet will have a   inspired design, so you can probably expect a metal frame with glass both front and back. In terms of specs, the Galaxy Tab S2 is likely to feature its current performance king Exynos Octa 7 processor as the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge. For the display, similar to its   series, it would be having an iPad-like 4:3 display aspect ratio, which is the current trend adopted by newer Android tablets."

In a bid to make it more accessible with greater value, Hotlink has slashed its new Tablet Plan SIM pack from RM60 to just RM30. It comes preloaded with 1GB of data and best of all, it is valid for 365 days. While this is good for those with very minimal data usage, the additional data top ups have been reduced as well. Initially priced at RM30 per GB, you can now top up 1GB extra at RM25 which is valid for 60 days. For greater value, you can top up 2GB for RM45 and this would be valid for 365 days. With a year long validity, you can top up more without the fear of wastage that’s usually the case for monthly validity plans.  There won’t be any extra charge if you exhausted your internet quota but you won’t be able to use it until you purchase another pass. Since it is targeted for tablet users, you can manage your account and buy internet top ups from their Hotlink RED App that’s available on Android and iOS. If your device has a phone function, you may also do so by calling *100#.  The Hotlink Tablet Plan is 4G enabled and do note that this is a data only plan, so you can’t use it to make calls and SMS. If you use a lot of data on the monthly basis, this is definitely not the plan for you. However with its year long validity with 2GB for RM45 top up option, this is perfect as an occasional backup SIM when WiFi isn’t available."

Amin Ashaari,3 features that make the Xiaomi Mi4i the most advanced phone below RM800 right now,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/24/3-features-that-make-the-xiaomi-mi4i-the-most-advanced-phone-below-rm800-right-now/,"Android,Android 5.0,mi 4i,miui 6.0,mobile devices,Xiaomi,Xiaomi launch,Xiaomi Mi 4i,Xiaomi Mi 4i Launch,Xiaomi Mi 4i Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-04-24,"Let’s face it, no matter how many times Hugo Barra calls the   a “flagship” smartphone, it’s not. The Mi4i lacks the raw power and many advance features that are present in what we consider flagship phones, like the iPhone 6, and the Galaxy S6. But that doesn’t mean you should discount the Mi4i as just another cheap phone from China, because the Mi4i is not just another cheap phone from China. Despite the competitive pricing, the engineers and designers at  looked into every detail to ensure that the Mi4i delivers a performance and user experience that belies its bargain basement asking price, it probably is the most advanced smartphone you can get for under RM800 and here’s why. At 138.1mm, the Mi4i is exactly the same height as the iPhone 6 but it has a screen that’s 10% larger than the iPhone and a 7% higher screen-to-body ratio. That means, you get more screen and less phone, as a result the phone is pleasant and easy to hold and operate with one hand. Even those with smaller hands and digits will find is easy to stretch their fingers to the edge of the Mi4i display without too much of a hassle. The Mi4i has an advanced display developed by Sharp and JDI. Yes, it only pushes out 1080p but the engineers has optimised the software and the screen to produce a display that’s actually pretty good especially under direct sunlight thanks to what Xiaomi calls “Sunlight Display” technology that optimises the screen in any lighting condition allowing you to appreciate details and highlights whether you’re viewing images indoors or outdoors. During our hands-on session at the launch The technology works extremely well and is something users can really appreciate.   The fully laminated OGS (one glass solution) screen developed by Corning, is on par with many top-level smartphone displays in the market and you get a very respectable pixel density of 441ppi. In comparison, the iPhone 6 pushes 326ppi and the iPhone 6 Plus, 401ppi. The display on the Mi4i is also capable of producing a wider range of colours compared to the iPhone 6. Specifically, the iPhone 6 has a NTSC 72% colour gamut while the display on the Mi4i has an NTSC 95% colour gamut. This means colours are brighter and reproduced to mimic reality more accurately. The only issue we have with the Mi4i display is that it uses Corning Concore glass instead of the tougher and more resilient to breaking Corning Gorilla Glass. That doesn’t mean that Corning Concore glass is not strong. It is plenty strong and just as scratch resistant as Gorilla Glass but ultimately, when subjected to the same forces, Corning Concore will break before Gorilla Glass.  A smartphone is useless if you have to charge it all the time. Thankfully, the Mi4i has a 3120mAh battery and that is huge even for high-end flagship standards. Let’s do a quick comparison, the iPhone 6 has a 1810mAh battery, while the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus has a 2915mAh battery. The Samsung Galaxy S6 has a 2550mAh battery while the Galaxy S6 edge has 2600mAh battery. Notice what those flagship devices have in common? All of them have smaller batteries compared to the Mi4i and they cost more than twice as much as the Chinese phone. Even against Xiaomi’s own Mi4, the Mi4i’s battery is 9% smaller in volume but with 12% higher battery density.  And it’s not just any large battery either, the Mi4i battery is developed by two of the world’s leading battery suppliers, Sony and Samsung, and it’s packed with tech. It’s the first battery in the world to feature 4.4V high-voltage technology with the highest energy density platform of 700Wh/L polymer cells. So what does that all mean? You can expect almost two days (1.5 days) of actual run time on a single charge, and when you do need to charge, the Mi4i supports quick charging technology that support 5V 2A charging which is capable of charging an empty battery to 40% capacity in one hour and get up to full charge in three hours."
soyacincau,Apple Watch: You want to wear it just for its looks,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/25/apple-watch-you-want-to-wear-it-just-for-its-looks/,"Apple iWatch,Apple Store Sydney,Apple Watch,apple watch edition,Apple Watch Edition Hands-on,Apple Watch First Impressions,Apple Watch Hands-on,Apple Watch Malaysia,apple watch sport,Apple Watch Sport Hands-on,Smart Watch,Watch OS","iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-04-25,"So we went to Australia just to get our hands on the new Apple Watch which has officially rolled out on Friday. To get a better idea what options are available, we visited an Apple Store in Sydney to have a hands-on with the entire range. The Watch comes in 3 different models – The Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, which varies greatly in pricing and type of materials used. To suit people with different wrist, it is available in either 38mm or 42mm sizes. As this is Apple’s first wearable device, we try to find out what’s the big deal and most importantly is it any good as a smart watch? Read on for our first impressions. Let’s start with the design of the watch piece. The Watch gets a square display but they made it look less boxy with its curved round edges and corners. This comes as a refreshing approach for a square smart watch considering the competition like the Pebble Steel, Samsung Gear 2 and LG G Watch quite boxy with sharp edges. As you glance upon the display, there’s very little distraction from the frame or bezels as the screen dominates the front entirely. The dark background throughout the interface helps to hide the borders of the actual screen, giving an illusion of an edge to edge display. At the back, it gets a large sensor that looks quite bulky in the promo pics but during our try-on session, it doesn’t feel protruding or uncomfortable at all. We give credit to Apple for taking an effort to make the back aesthetically pleasing unlike other smart watches that place their heart rate sensors haphazardly. Since the Watch uses a magnet guided induction charge, there’s no unsightly charging ports or pins around the device. Standing out from the rest is the digital crown which tries to mimic the look of traditional watches. This is mainly used for zooming and scrolling, which is a substitute for pinch to zoom function that’s going to be a chore on a smaller screen. In terms of feel, the digital crown scrolls very loosely and personally we felt that it could use some friction like a radio dial on Hi-Fi systems. Pressing the crown button brings you back to home while the secondary button next to it gives you access to your favourite 12 contacts. The heart of the watch is the home screen which is very different from anything we’ve seen so far. Instead of the usual grid of icons or list of apps, you are greeted with an explosion of icons that gives you a bigger picture of what the watch has to offer. Moving around this interface is like going through a map where you can browse around by zooming in and out and you can jump into a function by tapping on the icon. To access menus or extra options, the Watch uses Force Touch which is basically a stronger tap on the screen. In a way, this feels easier than to press and hold or having an extra settings icon which is tough to tap on a small screen. There are a number of high resolution watch faces to choose from but unfortunately there’s no option to add 3rd party ones for now. To view notifications, you can pull it down by swiping from the top, like how you would normally do on a smart phone. To take a peek on the things that matter to you, swiping up from the bottom brings you glance. This is basically a collection of widgets that give you bite size info like the latest weather update, next calendar appointments, stocks and more. For communications, the Watch works as an extension to your phone and you can make and receive phone calls as well as handling messages. There’s no on-display keyboard which is really impractical for this size but you do get the option to dictate your reply or select from a list of pre-defined replies. On top of that, the Apple Watch tries to offer new ways of communicating such as sketching with a finger, sending taps and even let the other person feel your heart beat recorded from the sensor. Beginning with the basic Apple Watch Sport, the base model gets an aluminium body which comes with a smooth matte finish along with a choice of colourful rubber straps. We tried on both 38mm and 42mm versions, and for a guy, we prefer the 42mm size which offers a larger display. For the front, it is toughen with Ion X, which is stronger than normal glass but it lacks the scratch resistance of its more expensive Apple Watch and Watch Editions. While it gets a lightweight aluminium body, the design is exactly the same as its more expensive models. The straps are removable too and it latches off easily by pressing its unlocking button at the rear of the watch pieces. Although it is sold only with the rubber strap, you can change this to other options as an add-on since it uses the same mounting mechanism across the range. 
For the sports rubber strap, it feels similar to the original Pebble watch but it feels thicker feel with rounded edges. Out of the box, the rubber strap actually comes in 3 pieces. A single main strap with the buckle while the secondary piece with the holes come in 2 sizes to match different wrist sizes. The Apple Watch Sports costs A$579 (RM1.6K) for 42mm and A$499 (RM1.3K) for the 38mm version. The “Apple Watch” is their mid-tier range and with a higher price tag, it gets a more appealing stainless steel body with a reflective mirror finish. This puts it on par with its more mainstream stainless steel watches, and even including the Pebble Steel to a certain extent. Also upgraded is a Sapphire glass at the front which is more resistant to scuffs and scratches. The Apple Watch with the cheapest Sports Band option costs A$799 (RM2,230) for 38mm and A$879 (RM2,460) for the 42mm size. On top of that, it has the widest range of straps available – the Rubber Sports Band, Classic Buckle, Milanese Loop, Modern Buckle, Leather Loop and Link Bracelet. The Classic Buckle which is available only in 38mm has an interesting mechanism that is more than meets the eye. At first it looks like a typical leather strap with a round buckle but in actual fact, the buckle latches on securely with magnets. For those with bigger hands, the Leather Loop is the only leather alternative and it gives you freedom of adjustments with the strap looped around and sticks onto itself with magnets. This is similar to the Milanese loop which is made with fine metal. The most expensive strap available is the Link Bracelet, which is a metal band with a butterfly style clasp. Usually with most metal bands, the strap is adjusted by removing individual pieces with a tool. However for the Apple Watch Link Bracelet, Apple seems to have reengineered the metal strap with a tiny release button on each removable piece so that you can adjust it by hand without having to use tools. As expected from Apple, this obviously comes at a price and the 42mm Apple Watch with the Link Bracelet goes for A$1,479 (RM4,115) and it costs A$679 (RM1,900) just for the strap alone! For those with deep pockets for finer things in life, the Watch Edition is probably the most expensive product Apple has ever made. Available in 18 Carat Rose Gold or Yellow Gold, the Apple Watch Edition feels noticeably heavier than the other 2 models. The price is like putting a car on your wrist, with the 38mm Rubber Sport Strap version (shown above) going for A$14,000 (RM39K) and it goes all the way up to A$24,000 (RM67K) for the Modern Buckle Version (as shown below). Although the strap is similar to the mid-tier Apple Watch, they come with matching pin and buckle colours in either Rose Gold or Yellow Gold. Even the Sport Strap comes with a golden pin instead of silver, just to give you your money’s worth. Probably the most epic part of the Apple Watch Edition is the box that it comes in. It is a nice leather box that closes securely with magnets and it has a built in induction charger in the middle. So at the end of the day, you can recharge your watch in the box and it is powered via lightning connector that’s included in the package. Apple is not the first to come out with a smart watch and as a first generation device, we can see how the Cupertino company is trying to do things different. Most smart watches these day focus too much on the tech side of things, leaving basic aesthetics such as the watch piece and strap designs as an afterthought. Like its previous products, Apple takes a considerably amount of attention on the design as much as the tech that goes behind it. The Apple Watch piece is good but the variety of straps are making a whole world of difference on the look and feel of the entire package. It is clear that Apple has done a lot of work on the straps especially its leather link and metal link bracelet design. In fact, the tool-less mechanism for the link bracelet has been patented by Apple as well. There’s a big contrast between tech companies and traditional watch makers on how a smart watch should be designed. The tech brands try to make a smart device look timeless and mainstream, while the watch makers are trying to find a way to make their creations smarter. For Apple, the watch seems to be developed from ground up with fashion and design in mind, which makes it appealing even before trying out how it actually works. At the same time, they didn’t try to conceal the fact that it is a smart watch and they embraced the non-classical squarish front glass and they managed to do it tastefully with an all glass appearance. However we can’t say the same about the usability. In an attempt to be different, it will take a while to get used to its touch and scroll combination. There’s also the scribble and heart beat messaging feature which we found to be gimmicky for actual day to day usage. In terms of performance, the high resolution transitions are nice to look at but when it comes to apps, there’s a noticeable delay when we try to load. We are not too sure if this could be connectivity related but this is based on our experience with the sample units on the floor. Perhaps we will get a better experience from a final retail unit. The Apple Watch is also not waterproof for swimming but they reckon it is resistant enough to wear into the shower. Probably the biggest hurdle is the 18 hour battery life, which means you’ll definitely need to charge this on a daily basis. This is probably the shortest battery life for a smart watch considering the Pebble can last us 4-5 days and the Gear 2 could last 2 days on most occasions. The Watch Edition looks beautiful with its gold finishes and it comes in a beautiful looking Edition box. However with an asking price going close to RM70,000, it costs more than certain Rolex models. For those solely looking at functionality, the Apple Watch Sports would do just fine. It is illogical to pay more for the same watch inside except for some cosmetic differences which supposedly add more bling to your wrist at exorbitant prices. So how is it like to use an Apple Watch on a day to day basis? We have received our unit along with other Australians as the first country in the world to get it. So stay tuned for our full review coming soon. In the mean time, if you have anything you want to know, please leave a comment down below.

Following its release of its  , Samsung has taken is flexible display technology to the next level on its latest flagship. Apart from being more ergonomic and stunning to look at, the Galaxy S6 edge also comes with extra features as well. We’ve listed the 6 things to discover with the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge after the break. Your smart phone is supposed to keep your friends and families closer and what better way to do it than to keep a swipe away from your thumb. Exclusive on the Galaxy S6 edge is a unique People Edge, where you can set your 5 favourite contacts on the edge of your phone. If you need to call or SMS any of them, you can now do so by simply swiping at the sides. In an event there’s a missed call or SMS, the People Edge will let you know by having a visible colour tab on the screen. In situations where you can’t answer phone calls, the edge also doubles up as an Edge notification light when placed face down. When there’s an incoming call from your 5 contacts, the preset colours will flash, letting you know who it is without revealing their details on the screen. So now you’ll know at a glance if it’s an urgent call that you need to take. Can’t answer the call? Just press and hold the heart rate sensor next to the camera. This will hang up the call and it will send an SMS to inform them that you’re unable to attend to the call. Like the GALAXY Note Edge, you can turn your Galaxy S6 edge as a night clock. This can be activated according to your preferred start and end time. The night clock display is dim enough to be visible without being a distraction. With its Super AMOLED display, it is quite power efficient and it shouldn’t take a major toll on battery life. With the Galaxy S6 edge in sleep mode, you can always check for notification on the edge display. By simply rubbing the edge from left to right repeatedly, you can take a glance if you have any missed calls, SMS or emails. This can be set under settings and you can choose the type of notifications to be displayed. Want more than just notifications? The Galaxy S6 edge opens up more possibilities with customisable Information Stream Panels. You can add anything from top news, twitter trends, stocks, sport scores or RSS feeds from the Edge screen settings. Similarly, you can view this by rubbing the edge display while the screen is off and you can scroll up or down to view the information stream panels."

There’s also 16GB of storage with microSD expansion, 8MP main and 2MP front cameras.

However do expect to pay more for the added storage. According to a tipster, the Galaxy S6 64GB would be priced at RM3,099 while the Galaxy S6 edge 64GB will be priced even more at RM3,599. As comparison, the current Galaxy S6 and S6 edge in 32GB capacity are priced at RM2,599 and RM3,099 respectively. So in short, you’re paying RM500 extra for double the storage. From the looks of it, that’s a lot to pay for just 32GB extra considering Apple charges about RM424 for a 48GB jump from 16GB to 64GB with its  .

While the exterior design retains the same look and feel, it also gets a fingerprint scanner that’s mounted at the front as a home button.  Meanwhile the One E9+ is supposedly the economical version but gets a much larger 5.5″ Quad HD display.

Launched at their first ever launch event outside of China, Xiaomi’s new phone looks more like a cheaper alternative to the   which saw it’s debut last year as opposed to being a full on upgrade where the Xiaomi Mi4i is pretty much a ‘lighter’ version of the Mi4. Xiaomi says that the new phone has a polycarbonate unibody design that is 12 percent thinner and 13 percent lighter than the Mi4, being only 7.8mm thick weighing in a 130g whereas it’s predecessor came in at 8.9mm and weighed 149g.

This will automatically adjusts the screen brightness and increases the quality of the image when in harsh sunlight. It’s supposedly much brighter and 30 percent more battery efficient as well, but we’ll find out for certain once we get to try it out. Under the hood, the Mi 4i sports a 2nd gen 64-bit quad-core Snapdragon 615 that runs at both 1.7GHz and 1.1GHz, with an Adreno 405 CPU. The processor is mated to 2GB RAM as well as 16GB storage and dual-SIM connectivity. Like it’s predecessors there’s seems to be no microSD slot. However it does have a slightly bigger battery 3120 mAH and supports Quick Charge and is rated to last about 1.5 days with average use. The Mi4i will also be Xiaomi’s first smartphone with Android 5.0 Lollipop with MIUI 6.0 out of the box and has been rated at 40.2k on Antutu. The rear camera is a Sony/Samsung 13 megapixel shooter with Xiaomi’s 5-element lens and f/2.0 aperture and the front snapper will be a 5 megapixel lens with 5-element lens, f/1.8 aperture as well as a 80 degree wide angle. The front camera will have the Beautify feature on by default due to popular demand, which adjusts the levels of beautification based on your estimated age. The camera combo is just slightly better than what the Mi4 has to offer with a very minor upgrade on part of the rear camera. Devices in India will also get to enjoy Visual IVR that will take the bite out the customer service experience on mobile letting you to skip voice prompts by displaying it all on screen instead. Visual IVR will be in the MIUI beta build in India first before it’s rolled out to everyone else.

For those who love taking food pics, there’s a cooking mode to make your #foodporn pics more vibrant.  The build quality should be similar with its current Xperia Z3 with the use of rounded metal frames on each end. In terms of colours, it is available in White, Black, Copper and Aqua Green. Another welcome change is having an exposed microUSB port as what we’ve seen in the  . This makes charging easier without the hassle of a waterproof flap cover.

soyacincau,Huawei announces its new flagship duo – the P8 and P8 Max,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/16/huawei-p8-p8-max-officially-launched/,"Android,Dual Sim,huawei,Huawei Ascend P8,Huawei P8,Huawei P8 Launch,Huawei P8 Malaysia,Huawei P8 Max,Huawei P8 Max Launch,Huawei P8 Max Malaysia,Huawei P8max,smart phone","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-04-16,"Huawei today has announced its new flagship smart phone line up with their new P8. Dropping its Ascend naming, the latest flagships now come in two sizes, the 5.2″ P8 and a larger 6.8″ P8 Max phablet. Both screens are still pushing Full HD 1080p resolution and powering the device is their in-house developed 64-bit Kirin 930/935 Octa-Core processor that boasts 2X the performance of its former Ascend P7.  With most brands focusing on premium design, Huawei has stepped up with a better crafted unibody metal design with a larger screen to body aspect ratio. Although the 5.2″ is big in size, it is roughly the same size as the 4.7″ iPhone 6. The P8 is still incredibly slim at 6.4mm while its larger P8 Max phablet has a respectably thin side profile at 6.8mm.  Its imaging capabilities take centre stage with what they claimed to be the world’s first 4-colour 13MP camera in RGBW format. For stable shots, it is also assisted by Optical Image Stabilisation that claims to tolerate shakes better at 1.2 degrees, which is double of the iPhone 6 Plus. There are a couple of camera tricks included which makes light painting a breeze with real time preview. For the front, it gets a 8MP selfie camera for the P8 and a 5MP shooter on the P8 Max. As usual, it also comes equipped with group selfie and beautification features.  There are a couple of new additions with the P8 including a new Knuckle Technology. This is basically a new gesture feature that lets you use your hand knuckles to draw or to crop images on the device. In terms of accessories, what we found interesting is an add-on 4.3″ E-ink display which is attached to the back of the device. This looks like an interesting alternative to the dual-screen YotaPhone.  Both P8 and P8 Max claims to provide more than a day’s worth of use on a single charge. The compact P8’s 2,600mAh capacity battery is rated to last 1.5 days on average or 1 day of heavy usage. Meanwhile the mammoth P8 Max with a huge 4,360mAh battery claims to push more than 2 days of use or 1.4 days for heavy duty users. To prolong its battery life, there are some software features like an App Firewall which blocks power hungry apps from running in the background. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 with its custom Emotion UI 3.1. For each model, it comes with either standard or high-spec version  and fortunately Huawei is packing 3GB of RAM across the range. The only difference is storage where the P8 gets 16GB for standard and 64GB for the premium model. For the P8 Max, it starts with a minimum of 32GB storage for the standard and it doubles up to 64GB for the premium version. To distinguise the versions, the standard version comes in Titanium Grey and Mystic Champagne, while the Premium version gets Carbon Black and Prestige Gold colour options. The Huawei P8 is a dual-SIM 4G LTE device which comes with 2 nano-SIM slots. If you need more storage, the 2nd SIM slot can be used for microSD expansion. Connectivity shouldn’t be an issue as it supports a wide array of 4G LTE bands in FDD and TDD standards, while reception has been improved with a dual antenna design. For those who roam a lot, the device has a Roaming+ feature that allows it to connect to your roaming partner telco 3X quicker than other devices. In terms of price, the P8 standard version goes for 499 Euros (RM1958) and 599 Euros (RM2352) for the premium model. The larger 6.8″ Huawei P8 max is priced at 549 Euros (RM2155) for standard and 649 Euros (RM2548) for Premium.  Overall the P8 is quite a huge step up from its previous P7 flagship and this is quite obvious with its higher price tag. On the Ascend P7, the performance was quite disappointing from its Kirin 910T processor which pales in comparison to its affordable Honor 6 with Kirin 920. With its price tag touching the RM2,000 mark, Huawei believes they are now on par with the establishments in terms of build quality and performance. During the event, Huawei has mentioned that the new devices will be available first in 30 countries and good news for us, Malaysia is part of the list."

The back gets a 13MP Sony IMX214 camera with 6 element f/2.0 lens while selfie shots are handled by its 5MP front camera. While the specs are similar with the OPPO Find 7 (sans Quad HD display), the battery isn’t replaceable but it gets a slightly larger 3,100mAh capacity battery. Overall it is 8.9mm thick and weighs 162 grams. Pricing wise, the 16GB version in Silk White is priced internationally at US$299 while the 64GB in Sandstone Black is priced at US$349.

Whenever your device needs to juice up, you can just leave it on a wireless charger without worrying about cables. For devices that doesn’t come with wireless charging built-in, the usual solution is to buy a wireless charging case or a cover with a charging coil built-in. Somehow the guys at Duracell think that’s too complicated so they have introduced something else instead.  What you’re seeing above is the Duracell micro USB Ring which houses the induction charger coil that can be plugged onto any device like a USB OTG thumb drive. While this sounds good for compatibility, the execution of it is rather flawed. To charge on the charging mat, you can probably imagine how impractical it is to position the ring on the wireless charger. Guess what, they actually thought of it and also included in this US$54 (about RM200) solution is a dummy stand so that it can support your device. In terms of support, it only supports PMA wireless charging which is different from the more popular Qi chargers that adopt WPC standards. Apparently its main company, P&G is a member of the Power Matters Alliance (PMA). A wireless charger that requires 3 separate components? We would rather stick to fast wired chargers any day."

The company’s first foray into audio was with their   in-ear earphones, of which the second generation Piston was launched not too long ago sporting the same styling as the Mi Headphones. The Piston is priced very cheaply too at RM 50, following Xiaomi’s tradition of having insanely cheap prices. Aside from the headphones, you also get a hard carrying case on top of a microfiber drawstring bag, which is a plus point considering a lot of headphones at this price tends to get a soft pouch at very best. The headphones also comes with a 3.5mm airplane adaptor, 1.4m Kevlar braided audio cable with volume control which terminates in a 3.5mm jack and a 3.5mm to 6.3mm gold plated adaptor. The audio cable also features a microphone behind the volume control as the headset is designed for mobile users, so it can be used to take calls as well. I don’t entirely like how the headset features a dual-wire design because it feels rather cluttered, but they can at least be removed for storage."

It gets the same design and form factor as its bigger brother but comes in a smaller and lighter package. At the front, it gets a 10.8″ ClearType Full HD Plus display and it runs on Intel’s 1.6GHz Quad-Core Atom x7-Z8700 processor, which Microsoft claims to deliver 80% performance of an Intel Core i3 processor.  There are 2 models available with the base version having 2GB of RAM and 64GB storage priced at RM1,989 including of GST. If you need more, the higher spec 4GB RAM and 128GB storage version is going for RM2,389. For now it is a WiFi only device supporting 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and Bluetooth 4.0. A 4G LTE version is said to be in the pipeline but Microsoft has yet to provide specific timelines for the Malaysian market. It also gets a front facing 3.5MP camera and a rear 8MP unit which both are capable of shooting Full HD 1080p resolution. In terms of options, the Surface 3 Type keyboard is sold separately at RM479 and it comes in choice of Black, Bright Blue and Red colours. If you plan to scribble, the Surface Pen which is also available in the same array of colours would cost you an extra RM189. There’s also a docking station for a full desktop experience with display, LAN and extra USB ports but it sets you back at RM769.  When compared to its larger Surface Pro 3, the Surface 3 is much lighter and thinner at 622 grams with a thickness of 8.7mm. The on-board battery is said to last 10 hours of video playback and for charging, it uses a more universal micro-USB port. So if you’re out of juice, you can easily charge using a power bank. Another key difference with the Surface Pro 3 is the kickstand, where it offers a fixed 3 step position. This according to Microsoft is done in order to reduce its thickness.  For the starting price of RM1,989, it does sound steep for a tablet. However with a full Windows 8.1 experience and the option to upgrade to Windows 10 when it is available, it is a step up for those who want a productivity tool in a compact tablet form factor. The price isn’t too bad considering the popular iPad Air 2 WiFi version is now   at RM2,045 for 64GB and RM2,384 for the 128GB version.  In our brief preview, it feels just as competent as a laptop and it should be good enough to handle all your web browsing, media viewing and office productivity needs. If you need more power for video editing, then you probably might want to consider its higher end Surface Pro 3 that comes with Core i3, i5 and i7 processor options.  If you’re interested, the Microsoft Surface 3 can be pre-ordered at the following links and stocks will be available for the general public on 5th May 2015.

soyacincau,Compared: Samsung Galaxy S6 vs iPhone 6,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/10/compared-samsung-galaxy-s6-vs-iphone-6/,"Comparison,iPhone 6,iPhone 6 Malaysia,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S6,Samsung Galaxy S6 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 vs iPhone 6","iPhone,Mobile Devices,Samsung",2015-04-10,"Think of a flagship smart phone, and both   and   should pop up on your consideration list right now. The iPhone 6 despite its premium price tag is still commanding a huge chunk of the smart phone market share. In the last quarter of 2014, the Cupertino company had   extensive smart phone line up.  Fast forward to Q2 2015, the latest flagship from Samsung has up the ante with better hardware and more attention to build quality and design than it did before. So if you’re in the market to get a high-end smart phone, which would you take? We outline the differences between the two and hopefully you can get a better idea of what to get.  Let’s start with the numbers. In terms of price, the Galaxy S6 has gone up significantly from its predecessor but it is still cheaper than the base iPhone 6 with 16GB storage that’s priced at RM2,702. For RM2,599, the Galaxy S6 offers double the storage at 32GB but this time it lacks a microSD card slot and a removable battery.  With a 5.1″ Quad HD display, the Galaxy S6 is bigger than the iPhone 6 but it is thinner by a tiny bit at 6.8mm versus the iPhone 6 at 6.9mm. With an all glass and metal body, the Galaxy S6 is slightly heavier by 9 grams. No doubt the screen on the Galaxy S6 is awesome with incredibly high pixel density but for this size, not many would be able to tell the difference between a 326ppi and 577ppi display. As a result, despite having a much larger 2,550mAh capacity battery, the Galaxy S6 battery life isn’t too far off from the iPhone 6 (1,810mAh), which means you’ll probably need to charge it before the sun sets if you’re a heavy duty user.  Meanwhile for the main camera, the S6 doubles the megapixel count (16MP vs 8MP) compared to the iPhone 6. For low light imaging, the Galaxy S6 aces with a larger f/1.9 aperture lens, while the iPhone 6 settles for f/2.2 for both sides. It is interesting to note that the iPhone 6 comes with dual-LED flash which should provide more natural lighting if required. The Galaxy S6 camera is pretty impressive and it take shots instantly with no hesitations. Don’t just take our word for it. In our recent blind camera test,   the Galaxy S6 over the iPhone 6 for better pictures.  In terms of added features, the Galaxy S6 now comes with a single touch fingerprint scanner, which unlocks instantly just like the iPhone 6’s Touch ID. The Galaxy S6 is also faster to charge with its adaptive fast charger (0-50% in 30 minutes) and you have the added convenience of wireless charging as well. On paper, logically, the Galaxy S6 is more worth for your money considering it offers more for less on the spec sheet list. With Samsung’s new 14nm Exynos 7420 processor, you can expect best in class performance and it shows from the benchmarks. It crushes other smart phones by a mile but it is interesting to note that the iPhone 6 aces in the Single Core test under GeekBench.  
 
 Numbers aside, the experience is what matters. Despite what you see on the spec sheet and benchmark numbers, you can hardly fault the iPhone 6 for its sheer smoothness even after prolonged usage. For now, the Galaxy S6 is buttery smooth and we felt that its new TouchWiz UI is more refined, but of course others would argue it isn’t skimmed down enough for a true stock Android experience.  When the Galaxy S6 first came out, many had accused it of being a copy but  . While the metal frame, audio jack and grilled speaker grill looks similar, the Galaxy S6 stands out with a different colour treatment on its glass body. Even the Gold Platinum colour looks more shimmering than the Gold version of the iPhone 6.  The button placements for both devices are similar with the volume controls on the left, while the power/wake button is placed on the right.  It all boils down to your preference. If you want the very latest device, a great camera and what we feel is better looking device right now, the Galaxy S6 is probably the one you should be considering. However for those who prefer a more simplified experience, the iPhone 6 has been a defacto choice and it has been able to hold on to its selling price very well since its launch in Malaysia in November last year. Furthermore, the iOS experience is more smooth and refined due to its closed ecosystem. Besides, Apple has greater control over both hardware and software. While the Galaxy S6 will eventually get newer Android updates, it is likely to take longer time compared to its Apple counterpart.  Samsung has worked from scratch to deliver a premium product which finally can be on the same league as HTC and Apple in terms of build quality. Probably the biggest Achilles heel is Samsung’s two flagships per year cycle where a newer Note will emerge late this year. Like most devices, you can expect the price start to plummeting when something new is around the corner. If you don’t intend of changing phones that often, resale value shouldn’t be much a concern. We know that there are people who take resale value very seriously and it is taken as an indicator of perceived premium and demand. Time will tell if this aspired perception would be a reality in the long run. Which would be the ultimate flagship choice? Leave your thoughts in the comments below."

At the time, it had set a new standard for a high-end Android flagship with a thin design, incredible Super AMOLED display and top notch internals.  No doubt the past few Galaxy S flagships have gotten better in hardware but its plastic build is not doing much justice to its capable performance. They have tried to make their smart phones feel more upmarket with the use of chrome and faux leather finishing, but that’s simply not enough to deliver a true premium feeling device. With today’s users demanding for more, Samsung has gone back to the drawing board for its latest Galaxy S6 flagship. Called as Project Zero, the new model was built from the ground up aspiring to create what’s next now and hopefully to set a new standard of smart phone design. The exterior has to be as top notch to reflect its new advancements on the inside. To deliver a premium experience, the first contact with the device is crucial. On the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, they have went with glass and metal as their core materials. For a more cutting edge design, the Galaxy S6 edge stands out as the world’s first device to feature a dual curve display. To create this is not an easy task and Samsung has used a unique 3D Thermoforming technology to create a double curve design for its front panel. Meanwhile for its back panel, the use of glass isn’t entirely new. To allow the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge stand out, they have used a nano-thin multi coating process to give its back panels a vibrant and dynamic finish. This creates an illusion of flowing metal and the way it reflects natural light is stunning at various angles.  The Gold Platinum variant appears more vibrant than other typical gold smart phones while the Emerald Green colour is unique which you can’t find on any other premium device.  For a comfortable and an upmarket feel, the latest flagship uses a sleek metal frame which undergoes diamond cutting and anodizing processes for a more refined feel. The result is a surrounding frame that’s smooth to touch and it feels reassuring to hold in the hands. The frames are not the same across the range as each colour will get a different shade of colour for a unique look. To protect the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge from daily scuffs and bumps, Samsung has used the latest Gorilla Glass 4 which is thinner, lighter and more damage resistant than its predecessors. For its body, a high strength aluminium that’s similarly used for aircrafts and automobile is being used. Samsung claims that it is 1.5X stronger and 1.2X more scratch resistant than other aluminium used on other smart phones today."

This is quite unusual for Xiaomi as they have been launching all of their key products in their home ground, China. Until now there’s hardly any clues on the new model except for its teaser that says the “ “. From some clues we’ve gathered, the upcoming device could be called the Mi 4i. We can’t confirm right now but this might be an international variant of its current   with support for wider 4G LTE bands. On Singapore’s IDA (Infocomm Development authority) database, a new Xiaomi smart phone with the model 2015015 was recently certified and it carries a marketing name of “Mi 4i”. This comes right after the recent   smart phone that   in Singapore and Malaysia last month. When we searched further, the Mi 4i had also   on GeekBench 3 with Qualcomm 64-bit Octa-Core processor clocked at 1.65GHz along with 2GB of RAM. In terms of performance, it showed an average score of 473 for single-core and 1422 for multi-core which isn’t much better from a Redmi Note 4G. Of course, these are pre-launch figures and what’s interesting is that it was running on Android 5.0.2 Lollipop. As you probably know, the   isn’t coming officially into Malaysia and the Mi 4i (if that’s the actual name) could be alternative that you’ve been waiting for. In terms of specs, it appears to be a notch below the Mi 4 with possibly a Snapdragon 615 processor (instead of Snapdragon 801) that’s mated to 2GB of RAM (instead of 3GB).  However with Lollipop out of the box, this could be an interesting contender if it is priced below RM1,000. Since it is launching in India, it has to be compelling enough to compete with the likes of Micromax. We’ll find out more in 2 weeks time."

Despite being a generation behind in terms of hardware, the Galaxy S5 did ok in this test. The Xperia Z3 however, failed to shine and is outclassed by its competitors. So what do you think?

There’s no credits to top up and you would only need to pay at the end of your monthly bill cycle. However that also opens up a possibility of bill shocks for something which you thought you never use.  By now you’ve probably heard stories of people raking up bills of thousands of ringgit due to accidental data usage or simply for roaming on the wrong network.  Operator Maxis wants to change the way people look at Postpaid especially where there’s a stigma that the operators are all out to get you. Recently they made some drastic changes from the way they charge for calls and data as well as making internet usage overseas cheaper and worry free.  Is it just lip service or have they actually made a difference? Read on to find out. For those using the old classic postpaid plans, most customers would have switched to a brand new smart phone but still hasn’t gotten a dedicated data plan. Usually by default, Mobile Data is switched on and telcos would usually charge a rather expensive Pay As You Go rate of 10 sen per 10KB. That’s RM10 per MB and can you imagine how much would it cost if you watched a couple of YouTube videos? Since last year, they have   of its old Pay As You Go Rates with a more simplified mechanism. For every 50MB you use, Maxis charges just RM10 for each block. So if you use 80MB, you’re charged only RM20 (2 x 50MB blocks). The best part is that Maxis caps your usage to 250MB at RM50/month so you won’t be charged beyond that. Of course, your speeds would be throttled down but you can always subscribe to a data plan to regain your speed. Also if you accidentally enabled Mobile Data, Maxis will not charge if you don’t use beyond 250KB in a single month. This is just another safety net for those who just want to stick to WiFi for their smart phone internet needs.  When using mobile data on Maxis, they will constantly remind you especially if you don’t have a plan. If you’re using a data-less plan like Maxis TalkMore, you’ll receive a message that you’re on their Mobile Internet Plan of RM10 per 50MB.  Once you’ve started using, they will keep reminding you each time you utilised a block of 50MB along with a quick update of your usage. In our test, we got a total of 7 SMS from start until hitting 250MB, so you definitely can’t miss it. Each SMS also comes with a tip that you would save more if you subscribe to a data plan by dialling *100#. You can top up from as little as RM2/day for 100MB to RM48/month for 1GB.  Want to know how much you’ve used before your bill arrives? With the newly revamped  , you can always check your unbilled amount and remaining data quota in real time. If need to use a lot of data at one go especially when you use your smart phone as a WiFi hotspot, you can always top up RM2 for 100MB or RM5 for 500MB from the app. Alternatively you can do this by dialing *100#. When making a trip overseas, staying in touch has never been easier. Upon arrival at a new country, you are likely to be bombarded with SMS, telling you the best network operator to roam. Switching networks manually can be a hassle and there are cases where your smart phone would jump to a different network, which could result a very expensive roaming bill. Fortunately Maxis has gotten rid of such complications and they would guarantee that you will always be connected to the right network.  For a worry free travel, Maxis offers   (Fair Usage Applies) for only RM38/day at over 106 countries. If you want something more affordable for basic Instant Messaging, there’s a cheaper DataRoam Saver at 15 countries for only RM10/day. While DataRoam saver comes with just 50MB high speed quota per day, there’s no extra charge once you’ve exceeded. To activate, just dial *100# upon arrival before enabling Data Roaming on your smart phone.  Another good reason to roam on Maxis is that you can overcome the Great Firewall in China. So instead of getting a local SIM where you’re unlikely to access Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, you still can share your moments without restrictions on Maxis. This is possible since it reroutes your internet traffic through Malaysia.  Oh by the way, for MaxisOne Plan customers (MaxisOne Plan/One Plan Lite/Business One Plan/Business One Plan Lite), Maxis is giving   at selected countries. This is applicable from now until 30th April.  For the ultimate Worry Free experience, why not give   a try? For a flat RM128/month, the MaxisOne Plan offers unlimited domestic calls and SMS and 2GB of mobile internet. If you exceed your internet quota, there’s no extra charge and this means there’s no way for you to exceed RM128/month. The only way to incur more charges is if you make the following: For a more affordable alternatives, there’s also MaxisOne Plan Lite at RM78/month and MaxisOne Plan Start at RM58/month. Both offers unlimited calls and SMS but only within the Maxis/Hotlink network. For internet, they come with 1GB and 100MB respectively each month. The 5 claims mentioned here are part of Maxis  . Like most products in the market, you probably wonder if there’s any catch or hidden conditions. The word “unlimited” has been overused and there’s always a tingling sensation that there’s a hidden charge somewhere."
